Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the \u00cele-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2017 population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France. The Paris Region had a GDP of \u20ac709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Z\u00fcrich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva. Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.The city is a major railway, highway and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe) and Paris\u2013Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris M\u00e9tro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily; it is the second busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway station in the world, but the first located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015. Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2019, with 9.6 million visitors.  However, the number of visitors plunged by 72 percent to 2.7 million visitors in 2020, due to the COVID virus and the drop in the number of foreign visitors.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site, and popular landmarks there included the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur on the hill of Montmartre.\nParis received 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. It was ranked as the second  most visited travel destination in the world in 2019, after Bangkok and just ahead of London. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Fran\u00e7ais are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.\n\n\n", "1": "\n\nThe name 'Paris' is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period. The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym is debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the root pario- ('cauldron'). Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-. Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr 'spear', derived from an earlier *kwar-s\u0101. In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.\nParis is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (La Ville Lumi\u00e8re), both because of its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment and more literally because Paris was one of the first large European cities to use gas street lighting on a grand scale on its boulevards and monuments. Gas lights were installed on the Place du Carrousel, Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards were lit. By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps. Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.Inhabitants are known in English as \"Parisians\" and in French as Parisiens ([pa\u0281izj\u025b\u0303] (listen)). They are also pejoratively called Parigots ([pa\u0281i\u0261o] (listen)).\n\n\n", "2": "\n\n\n", "3": "\n\nThe Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC. One of the area's major north\u2013south trade routes crossed the Seine on the \u00eele de la Cit\u00e9; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became an important trading centre. The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for that purpose.\n\nThe Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris' Left Bank. The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, \"Lutetia of the Parisii\", modern French Lut\u00e8ce). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as Parisius, a Latin name that would later become Paris in French. Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508.  As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris' strategic importance\u2014with its bridges preventing ships from passing\u2014was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885\u201386), for which the then Count of Paris (comte de Paris), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia. From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (duc des Francs), as king of a unified Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.\n\n\n", "4": "\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France. The Palais de la Cit\u00e9, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.\nAfter the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in around the 10th century, Paris' cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 and Place de la Gr\u00e8ve (Place de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.\nIn the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.\nIn the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed. The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris' streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal, which he bequeathed to Louis XIII. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today. Other marks of his reign were the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vend\u00f4me, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.\n\n\n", "5": "\n\nParis grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. A new boulevard, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, extended the city west to \u00c9toile, while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclop\u00e9die in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.\n\nIn the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage for the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the H\u00f4tel de Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly.\n\nLouis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined (executed) in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France. The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished. A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (coup d'\u00e9tat du 18 brumaire), when Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.\n\nThe population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000. Napoleon Bonaparte replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect reporting only to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.\n\nDuring the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names, but the July Revolution of 1830 in Paris, (commemorated by the July Column on Place de la Bastille), brought a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I, to power. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.\nLouis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. After months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. On 28 March, a revolutionary government called the Paris Commune seized power in Paris. The Commune held power for two months, until it was harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.\n\nLate in the 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower; and the 1900 Universal Exposition, which gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris M\u00e9tro line. Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (\u00c9mile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).\n\n\n", "6": "\n\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to 2,715,000. At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art, and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.During the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as Les Ann\u00e9es Folles, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Ana\u00efs Nin, Sidney Bechet Allen Ginsberg and the surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed.In the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor.\n\nOn 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an \"open city\". On 16\u201317 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv (V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back. On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the H\u00f4tel de Ville.In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses. In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793. The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 metres (689 feet) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high. The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs. A suburban railway network, the RER (R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional), was built to complement the M\u00e9tro, and the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.Most of the postwar's Presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing began the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (1986); President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the Op\u00e9ra Bastille (1985\u20131989), the new site of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (1996), the Arche de la D\u00e9fense (1985\u20131989), and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983\u20131989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly.In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delano\u00eb became the first Socialist Mayor of Paris. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the V\u00e9lib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delano\u00eb also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.In 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016. In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 kilometres (127 miles) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of \u20ac35 billion. The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.\n\n\n", "7": "\n\nBetween July and October 1995, a series of bombings carried out by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria caused 8 deaths and more than 200 injuries.On 7 January 2015, two French Muslim extremists attacked the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo and killed thirteen people, in an attack claimed by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and on 9 January, a third terrorist, who claimed he was part of ISIL, killed four hostages during an attack at a Jewish grocery store at Porte de Vincennes. On 11 January an estimated 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech. On 13 November of the same year, a series of coordinated bomb and gunfire terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis, claimed by ISIL, killed 130 people and injured more than 350.On 3 February 2017, a two-backpack-carrying, machete-wielding attacker shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" attacked soldiers guarding the Louvre museum after they stopped him because of his bags; the assailant was shot, and no explosives were found. On 18 March of the same year, in a Vitry-sur-Seine bar, a man held patrons hostage, then fled to later hold a gun to the head of an Orly Airport French soldier, shouting \"I am here to die in the name of Allah\", and was shot dead by the soldier's comrades. On 20 April, a man fatally shot a French police officer on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and was later shot dead himself. On 19 June, a man rammed his weapons-and-explosives-laden vehicle into a police van on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, but the car only burst into flames.\n\n\n", "8": "\n\n\n", "9": "\n\nParis is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the \u00cele Saint-Louis and the larger \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river. Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi). The metropolitan area of the city is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).Measured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is 450 kilometres (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.\n\n\n", "10": "\n\nParis has a typical Western European oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet. Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 \u00b0C (59 and 77 \u00b0F), and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for weeks, reached 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night. Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons. In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dip below \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F). Snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground.

The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974. The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793. The mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014 and re-elected 28 June 2020.The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 34 members for the most populated (the 15th). The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system.  Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round \u2013 or at least a plurality in the second round \u2013 automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement.  The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.  This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they don't win an absolute majority of the vote.\n\nOnce elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government, primarily because it meets only once a month. The council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre-right, plus a few members from smaller parties.Each of Paris' 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor. The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.The budget of the city for 2018 is 9.5 billion Euros, with an expected deficit of 5.5 billion Euros. 7.9 billion Euros are designated for city administration, and 1.7 billion Euros for investment. The number of city employees increased from 40,000 in 2001 to 55,000 in 2018. The largest part of the investment budget is earmarked for public housing (262 million Euros) and for real estate (142 million Euros).\n\n\n", "13": "\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016. It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 square kilometres (314 square miles) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, a Republican and the mayor of the town of Rueil-Malmaison, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.\n\n\n", "14": "\nThe Region of \u00cele de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.\n\n\n", "15": "\n\nAs the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in the 8th arrondissement, while the Prime Minister's seat is at the H\u00f4tel Matignon in the 7th arrondissement. Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Matignon.The two houses of the French Parliament are located on the Left Bank. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement, while the more important lower house, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, meets in the Palais Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the \"Petit Luxembourg\", a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.\n\nFrance's highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, while the Conseil d'\u00c9tat, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.\nFollowing the motto \"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris\"; the only sister city of Paris is Rome, although Paris has partnership agreements with many other cities around the world.\n\n\n", "16": "\n\nThe security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis L\u00e9pine on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9.There are 30,200 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events.\nThe police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. The traditional kepis of the gendarmes were replaced in 2002 with caps, and the force modernised, though they still wear kepis for ceremonial occasions.Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\n\n\n", "17": "\n\n\n", "18": "\n\nMost French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the \u00cele Saint-Louis and the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. A third one is the 1827 artificially created \u00cele aux Cygnes.\n\nModern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey \"Paris stone\". They also built the major parks around the city centre. The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.\n\nParis' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974\u20132010 building height limitation of 37 metres (121 ft) was raised to 50 m (160 ft) in central areas and 180 metres (590 ft) in some of Paris' peripheral quarters, yet for some of the city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect. The 210 metres (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building until 1973, but this record has been held by the La D\u00e9fense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.\nParisian examples of European architecture date back more than a millennium, including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (1014\u20131163), the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163\u20131345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239\u20131248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627\u20131641) and Les Invalides (1670\u20131708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808\u20131842), the Palais Garnier serving as an opera house (1875), the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (1875\u20131919), as well as the exuberant Belle \u00c9poque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking examples of 20th-century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie by various architects (1986), the Arab World Institute by Jean Nouvel (1987), the Louvre Pyramid by I. M. Pei (1989) and the Op\u00e9ra Bastille by Carlos Ott (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly \u2013 Jacques Chirac by Jean Nouvel (2006), the contemporary art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014) and the new Tribunal de grande instance de Paris by Renzo Piano (2018).\n\n\n", "19": "\nThe most expensive residential streets in Paris in 2018 by average price per square meter were Avenue Montaigne (8th arrondissement), at 22,372 Euros per square meter; Place Dauphine (1st arrondissement; 20,373 euros) and Rue de Furstemberg (6th arrondissement) at 18,839 Euros per square meter. The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).Sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date. Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than \u00cele-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire \u00cele-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one. Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 24 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 26 percent in the 14th arrondissement and 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement, on the poorer southwest and northern edges of the city.On the night of 8\u20139 February 2019, during a period of cold weather, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.\n\n\n", "20": "\n\nAside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris' administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. This problem was 'resolved' when its parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed \"\u00cele-de-France\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the \u00cele-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration. Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris came into existence.Paris' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs m\u00e9sentente when he became head of the Paris region in 1961: two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban \"villes nouvelles\" (\"new cities\") and the RER commuter train network. Many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population: These districts were socially mixed at first, but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s). Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.These areas, quartiers sensibles (\"sensitive quarters\"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in \u00c9vry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.The Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.\n\n\n", "21": "\n\nThe official estimated population of the City of Paris was 2,206,488 as of 1 January 2019, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. This is a decline of 59,648 from 2015, close to the total population of the 5th arrondissement.  Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks. This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, to the departure of middle-class residents. and partly to the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".\n\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017. It declined again in 2018.\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglom\u00e9ration Parisienne, and statistically as a unit\u00e9 urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's 2017 population of 10,784,830 made it the largest urban area in the European Union. City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire urbaine de Paris (\"urban area\", but a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area), that had a 2017 population of 12,628,266, a number 19% the population of France, and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.\n\n\n", "22": "\nAccording to the 2012 French census, 586,163 residents of the City of Paris, or 26.2 percent, and 2,782,834 residents of the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France), or 23.4 percent, were born outside of metropolitan France (the last figure up from 22.4% at the 2007 census). 26,700 of these in the City of Paris and 210,159 in the Paris Region were people born in Overseas France (more than two-thirds of whom in the French West Indies) and are therefore not counted as immigrants since they were legally French citizens at birth.A further 103,648 in the City of Paris and in 412,114 in the Paris Region were born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth. This concerns in particular the many Christians and Jews from North Africa who moved to France and Paris after the times of independence and are not counted as immigrants due to their being born French citizens. The remaining group, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under French law. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific. Note that the immigrants from the Americas and the South Pacific in Paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.In the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific. These last two groups of immigrants are again vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in the Americas and the South Pacific.In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France).\n\n\n", "23": "\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world.

In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish, and 25 percent as without religion.\nAccording to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.

The story is similar in the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.At the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.The Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 p\u00f4les d'emplois or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or quartier central des affaires; it is in the western part of the City of Paris, in the 2nd, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 18th arrondissements. In 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the \u00cele-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La D\u00e9fense, just west of the city, where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La D\u00e9fense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.The top ten French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2018 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region; six in the central business district of the City of Paris; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La D\u00e9fense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt.

While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011, the Paris region's GDP accounted for 30 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.The Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.). The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La D\u00e9fense business district places Paris' economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, La D\u00e9fense and the Val de Seine. While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.In the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.Station F is a business incubator for startups, located in 13th arrondissement of Paris.

Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology, and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages. The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.

Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the City of Paris and 8.8 percent in the \u00cele-de-France region in the first trimester of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants live.While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than \u20ac977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; 24 percent in the 18th, 22 percent in the 20th and 18 percent in the 10th. In the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line; 8 percent in the 6th arrondissement; and 9 percent in the 16th arrondissement.\n\n\n", "29": "\n\nGreater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received 38 million visitors in 2019, a record, measured by hotel arrivals.

As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\". Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.\n\nParis was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: \u00c9douard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Gericault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907. Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production.\nThe most prestigious names of French and foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era, are Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty \u2013 Liberty Enlightening the World), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n", "34": "\nThe inventor Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Ni\u00e9pce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s.  The work of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eug\u00e8ne Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Ch\u00e9ret, Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.\n\n\n", "35": "\n\nThe Louvre received 9.6 million visitors in 2019, ranking it the most visited museum in the world., though that number dropped to 2.7 million visitors in 2020, due to the COVID virus.  Its treasures include the Mona Lisa (La Joconde), the Venus de Milo statue, Liberty Leading the People.  The second-most visited museum in the city, with 3.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne. The third most visited Paris museum, in a building constructed for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900 as the Orsay railway station, was the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, which had 3.3 million visitors in 2019. The Orsay displays French art of the 19th century, including major collections of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large Water Lilies murals. The Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art, including the famous tapestry cycle of The Lady and the Unicorn. The Guimet Museum, or Mus\u00e9e national des arts asiatiques, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Mus\u00e9e Picasso, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin and the Mus\u00e9e national Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\n\nParis hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie at La Villette. It attracted 2.2 million visitors in 2018. The National Museum of Natural History located near the Jardin des plantes attracted two million visitors in 2018. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. The military history of France, from the Middle Ages to World War II, is vividly presented by displays at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e at Les Invalides, near the tomb of Napoleon. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris. There are also notable private museums; The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne. It received 1.1 million visitors in 2018.\n\n\n", "36": "\n\nThe largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Op\u00e9ra Garnier (historical Paris Op\u00e9ra) and modern Op\u00e9ra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern. In middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Op\u00e9ra-Comique (which still exists), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville). Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913.\n\nTheatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal at 2 rue de Richelieu, next to the Louvre. of Other famous theatres include the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe, next to the Luxembourg Gardens, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador, and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9-Montparnasse.The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and \u00c9dith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Berg\u00e8re. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.\nThe Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.\n\n\n", "37": "\n\nThe first book printed in France, Epistolae (\"Letters\"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Moli\u00e8re, Racine, several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the caf\u00e9s and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais.\nDuring the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, \u00c9mile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Mis\u00e9rables, written while he was in exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, and, in the 1970s, Milan Kundera. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano (who lives in Paris), based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s\u20131970s.Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.\n\n\n", "38": "\n\nIn the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouv\u00e8res of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.\nRomantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz (La Symphonie fantastique), Charles Gounod (Faust), Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (Samson et Delilah), L\u00e9o Delibes (Lakm\u00e9) and Jules Massenet (Tha\u00efs), among others. Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy (Suite bergamasque, and its well-known third movement, Clair de lune, La Mer, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande), Erik Satie (Gymnop\u00e9dies, \"Je te veux\", Gnossiennes, Parade) and Maurice Ravel (Miroirs, Bol\u00e9ro, La valse, L'heure espagnole). Several foreign-born composers, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (Poland), Franz Liszt (Hungary), Jacques Offenbach (Germany), Niccol\u00f2 Paganini (Italy), and Igor Stravinsky (Russia), established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris.\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle \u00e0 roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s.Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the caf\u00e9s of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf\u2014a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars. Other singers\u2014of similar style\u2014include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet.\nParis has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s. The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and social status for many minorities.\n\n\n", "39": "\n\nThe movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Caf\u00e9 on 28 December 1895. Many of Paris' concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris' largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Biblioth\u00e8que with 20 screens and UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (r\u00e9alisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated. On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.\n\n\n", "40": "\n\nSince the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand V\u00e9four in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, Maison Dor\u00e9e and the Caf\u00e9 Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and \u00c9mile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.Today, due to Paris' cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants. The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick All\u00e9no and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.\n\nIn addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The caf\u00e9 arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian caf\u00e9s were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Caf\u00e9 Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially Caf\u00e9 de la Rotonde and Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9 in Montparnasse and Caf\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like caf\u00e9s, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\n\n\n", "41": "\n\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients). It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar. The other fashion capitals of the world, Milan, London, and New York also host fashion weeks. Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Or\u00e9al as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e9s, and Cartier.

In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France, while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the \u00cele-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.\nThe Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes \u00e9coles \u2013 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands \u00e9tablissements. Most of the grandes \u00e9coles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement. There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the Paris Institute of Technology which comprises several colleges such as \u00c9cole Polytechnique, \u00c9cole des Mines, AgroParisTech, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Arts et M\u00e9tiers, and \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris' 7th arrondissement, the most prestigious university for social sciences, the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales is located in Paris' 6th arrondissement and the most prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris' 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA department of the Paris-Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Paris is also home to several of France's most famous high-schools such as Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly and Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet. The National Institute of Sport and Physical Education, located in the 12th arrondissement, is both a physical education institute and high-level training centre for elite athletes.\n\n\n", "44": "\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (BnF) operates public libraries in Paris, among them the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Op\u00e9ra Library, and Arsenal Library. There are three public libraries in the 4th arrondissement. The Forney Library, in the Marais district, is dedicated to the decorative arts; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building, and has a large collection on French literature; and the Biblioth\u00e8que historique de la ville de Paris, also in Le Marais, contains the Paris historical research service. The Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library is in 5th arrondissement; designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s, it contains a rare book and manuscript division. Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine, in the 6th arrondissement, is the oldest public library in France. The M\u00e9diath\u00e8que Musicale Mahler in the 8th arrondissement opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand Library (nicknamed Tr\u00e8s Grande Biblioth\u00e8que) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.There are several academic libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library in the 5th arrondissement is the largest university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ib\u00e9riques. Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo da Vinci University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the Ren\u00e9 Descartes University Library.\n\n\n", "45": "\n\nParis' most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis. It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the French national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Fran\u00e7ais rugby team. In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Fran\u00e7ais Paris.\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Two UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000 and 2006 editions. Paris has most recently been the host for UEFA Euro 2016, both at the Parc des Princes in the city proper and also at Stade de France, with the latter hosting the opening match and final.\nThe final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris. Since 1975, the race has finished on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.Tennis is another popular sport in Paris and throughout France; the French Open, held every year on the red clay of the Roland Garros National Tennis Centre, is one of the four Grand Slam events of the world professional tennis tour. The 17,000-seat Bercy Arena (officially named AccorHotels Arena and formerly known as the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy) is the venue for the annual Paris Masters ATP Tour tennis tournament and has been a frequent site of national and international tournaments in basketball, boxing, cycling, handball, ice hockey, show jumping and other sports. The Bercy Arena also hosted the 2017 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, together with Cologne, Germany. The final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1951 and EuroBasket 1999 were also played in Paris, the latter at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy.\nThe basketball team Levallois Metropolitans plays some of its games at the 4,000 capacity Stade Pierre de Coubertin. Another top-level professional team, Nanterre 92, plays in Nanterre.\n\n\n", "46": "\n\n\n", "47": "\n\nParis is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'\u00cele-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region. The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the M\u00e9tro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.\n\n\n", "48": "\n\nA central hub of the national rail network, Paris' six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: the TGV serving four high-speed rail lines, the normal speed Corail trains, and the suburban rails (Transilien).\n\n\n", "49": "\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's M\u00e9tro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily through 16 lines, 303 stations (385 stops) and 220 km (136.7 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines (A, B, C, D, and E), 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area.Over \u20ac26.5 billion will be invested over the next 15 years to extend the M\u00e9tro network into the suburbs, with notably the Grand Paris Express project.\nIn addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: Line T1 runs from Asni\u00e8res-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, Line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles, Line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes, Line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte d'Asni\u00e8res, Line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles, Line T6 runs from Ch\u00e2tillon to Viroflay, Line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, Line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, all of which are operated by the RATP Group, and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF. Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.\n\n\n", "50": "\n\nParis is a major international air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle, Paris\u2013Orly and Beauvais\u2013Till\u00e9 Airport. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014. There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows.\nOrly Airport, located in the southern suburbs of Paris, replaced Le Bourget as the principal airport of Paris from the 1950s to the 1980s. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993. For the year 2017 it was the 5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France. Beauvais-Till\u00e9 Airport, located 69 kilometres (43 miles) north of Paris' city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair.\nDomestically, air travel between Paris and some of France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg has been in a large measure replaced by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014. After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.Internationally, air traffic has increased markedly in recent years between Paris and the Gulf airports, the emerging nations of Africa, Russia, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and mainland China, whereas noticeable decline has been recorded between Paris and the British Isles, Egypt, Tunisia, and Japan.\n\n\n", "51": "\n\nThe city is also the most important hub of France's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways.\n\n\n", "52": "\nThe Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhone, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.\n\n\n", "53": "\n\nThere are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include piste cyclable (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and bande cyclable (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles. Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a bike sharing system called V\u00e9lib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations, which can be rented for short and medium distances including one way trips.\n\n\n", "54": "\nElectricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. As of 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the \u00cele-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent Nuclear Power Plant (35%), trash incineration (9% \u2013 with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh). A quarter of the city's district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from the United States per year.\n\n\n", "55": "\n\nParis in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bi\u00e8vre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital. From 1857, the civil engineer Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation. From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris' principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris' streets. This system is still a major part of Paris' modern water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground passageways dedicated to the evacuation of Paris' liquid wastes.\nIn 1982, Mayor Chirac introduced the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets. The project was abandoned in 2002 for a new and better enforced local law, under the terms of which dog owners can be fined up to \u20ac500 for not removing their dog faeces. The air pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 \u03bcg/m3.\n\n\n", "56": "\n\nParis today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees. Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden (created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre between 1664 and 1672) and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate. The Jardin des plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by Louis XIII's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants.Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters. Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007). One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks.\nWeekly Parkruns take place in the Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Montsouris \n\n\n", "57": "\n\nDuring the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines outside the \"Porte d'Enfer\" city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement. The process of moving bones from the Cimeti\u00e8re des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.\nAfter a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of P\u00e8re Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Bagneux. Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries, such as Oscar Wilde and Serge Gainsbourg among others.\n\n\n", "58": "\n\nHealth care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals. It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.One of the most notable hospitals is the H\u00f4tel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city, although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital (one of the largest in Europe), H\u00f4pital Cochin, Bichat\u2013Claude Bernard Hospital, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou, Bic\u00eatre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital, Necker\u2013Enfants Malades Hospital, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9 and the American Hospital of Paris.\n\n\n", "59": "\n\nParis and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including Le Monde, Le Figaro, Lib\u00e9ration, Le Nouvel Observateur, Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9, La Croix, Pariscope, Le Parisien (in Saint-Ouen), Les \u00c9chos, Paris Match (Neuilly-sur-Seine), R\u00e9seaux & T\u00e9l\u00e9coms, Reuters France, and L'Officiel des Spectacles. France's two most prestigious newspapers, Le Monde and Le Figaro, are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry. Agence France-Presse is France's oldest, and one of the world's oldest, continually operating news agencies. AFP, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in Paris, as it has since 1835. France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government, and is based in Paris. Another news agency is France Diplomatie, owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.The most-viewed network in France, TF1, is in nearby Boulogne-Billancourt. France 2, France 3, Canal+, France 5, M6 (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Arte, D8, W9, NT1, NRJ 12, La Cha\u00eene parlementaire, France 4, BFM TV, and Gulli are other stations located in and around the capital. Radio France, France's public radio broadcaster, and its various channels, is headquartered in Paris' 16th arrondissement.

It\u2019s a bar chart of the busiest train stations in the world, measured by the number of people who pass through them each year.\nPerhaps coming as no surprise to those who have experienced its mind-numbingly complex transport complexes, Japan tops the list. What is surprising is the degree to which Japan dominates this list, with all but six stations residing here, and about half of them in the Tokyo area alone.\nThe following are the five busiest train stations in the world.\n#5 Yokohama Station (Kanagawa) \u2013 Approx. 760,000,000 people per year\nLocated in Yokohama city near the border of Kanagawa Prefecture and Tokyo, this was one one of Japan\u2019s first great stations. A few moves and destruction caused by the Great Kanto Earthquake left it in its current location now.\nThe station is the nucleus to a vertically and horizontally sprawling commercial area hosting most if not all of Japan\u2019s major chain stores like Takashimaya and Yodobashi Camera.\n#4 Umeda Station (Osaka) \u2013 Approx. 820,000,000\nAs a resident of Osaka, this station is my own slice of nightmare. Every time I go there it tends to end with me huddled in a corner crying. This multilevel serpentine station hosts ever running rivers of people bumping into one another walking in every direction at the same time.\nRemember one of those typical video game levels where you constantly walk through one door only to find yourself in the same room until you throw your controller at your little brother? It\u2019s kind of like that.\n#3 Ikebukuro Station (Tokyo) \u2013 Approx. 910,000,000\nLocated in the heart of Tokyo, it\u2019s no wonder Ikebukuro station is so heavily used. As a result it\u2019s home to a bevy of attractions like gourmet hotdogs, penguins on waterslides, alleged teenage girl viewing clubs, and the occasional Cornman sighting.\n#2 Shibuya Station (Tokyo, Japan) \u2013 Approx. 1,090,000,000\nAlso in the center of Tokyo, Shibuya station has a kind of nice atmosphere to it that can almost distract an agoraphobe from the hordes of commuters passing through. The station also features large, eye-catching artwork from Taro Okamoto.\nThere\u2019s also a statue to Hachiko near one of the exits. Hachiko was the dog immortalized in Japanese and (to a lesser extent) American movies as the dog who faithfully waited for his dead master outside of Shibuya station for nine years.\n#1 Shinjuku Station (Tokyo, Japan) \u2013 Approx. 1,260,000,000\nMany people are often in awe of Shinjuku Station\u2019s massive size or complain about its complexity, built to handle over one million daily commuters. \nHere\u2019s the full list of 51 stations.  \n1  Shinjuku (Tokyo, Japan)\n2  Shibuya (Tokyo, Japan)\n3  Ikebukuro (Tokyo, Japan)\n4  Umeda (Osaka, Japan)\n5  Yokohama (Kanagawa, Japan)\n6  Kita-Senju (Tokyo, Japan)\n7  Nagoya (Aichi, Japan)\n8  Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan)\n9  Shinagawa (Tokyo, Japan)\n10 Takadanobaba (Tokyo, Japan)\n11 Namba (Osaka, Japan)\n12 Shinbashi (Tokyo, Japan)\n13 Tennoji (Osaka, Japan)\n14 Akihabara (Tokyo, Japan)\n15 Kyoto (Kyoto, Japan)\n16 Sannomiya (Kobe, Japan)\n17 Omiya (Saitama, Japan)\n18 Yurakucho-Hibiya (Tokyo, Japan)\n19 Nishi-Funabashi (Chiba, Japan)\n20 Meguro (Tokyo, Japan)\n21 Daimon-Hamamatsucho (Tokyo, Japan)\n22 Ueno (Tokyo, Japan)\n23 Oshiage (Tokyo, Japan)\n24 Paris Nord (Paris, France)\n25 Taipei Railway Station (Taipei,Taiwan)\n26 Machida (Tokyo, Japan)\n27 Gare de Chatelet (Paris, France)\n28 Kawasaki (Kanagawa, Japan)\n29 Roma Termini Railway Station (Rome, Italy)\n30 Tamachi-Mita (Tokyo, Japan)\n31 Kyobashi (Osaka, Japan)\n32 Funabashi (Chiba, Japan)\n33 Ayase (Tokyo, Japan)\n34 Hamburg Central Station (Hamburg, Germany)\n35 Yoyogi-Uehara (Tokyo, Japan)\n36 Kamata (Kamata, Japan)\n37 Gotanda (Tokyo, Japan)\n38 Kichijoji (Tokyo, Japan)\n39 Kanayama (Aichi, Japan)\n40 Musashikosugi (Kanagawa, Japan)\n41 Fujisawa (Kanagawa, Japan)\n42 Oimachi (Tokyo, Japan)\n43 Nakano (Tokyo, Japan)\n44 Tachikawa (Tokyo, Japan)\n45 Iidabashi (Tokyo, Japan)\n46 Kashiwa (Chiba, Japan)\n47 Hakata (Fukuoka, Japan)\n48 Tsuruhashi (Osaka, Japan)\n49 Nishi-Nippori (Tokyo, Japan)\n50 Nakameguro (Tokyo, Japan)\n51 Zurich Main Station (Zurich, Switzerland)\nSource: Himasoku (Japanese)\nRead more stories on RocketNews24.\n-- Man Offers to Cover His Body in Advertisements, Rides Japan\u2019s Busiest Train All Day\n-- Finally, an Udon Museum Where You Can Taste the Difference\n-- Sakhalin as Seen From a Japanese Tourist in 42 Points\n\u00a9 RocketNews24\nA couple of days ago, a graph surfaced online displaying some interesting statistics.

One suspect, Khalid Kelkal, identified as a ringleader, was gunned down by the police near Lyon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Bensa\u00efd and Mr. Belkacem, who were arrested in 1995, were among 36 Algerians sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in 1998 for belonging to a terrorist organization. Since 1995, France has been demanding the extradition from Britain of another Algerian, Rachid Ramda, 33, accused of helping to finance the terrorist group. Britain approved the extradition, but the ruling was reversed by a London court. Mr. Ramda is still in detention in London.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nContinue reading the main story\n\n  \n\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Another defense counsel, Guillaume Barbe, said that though the court was under enormous pressure to convict Mr. Bensa\u00efd ''to ease the pain of the victims,'' it should have the courage to acquit him.The case against Mr. Belkacem rested on a M\u00e9tro ticket that showed he had left the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay M\u00e9tro station just minutes before the bomb blast. His lawyer, Philippe Van der Meulen, did not challenge this evidence, but argued instead that Mr. Belkacem turned radical only after the Algerian government annulled elections likely to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front in 1992. The civil war that followed the cancellation of the elections is estimated to have taken more than 100,000 lives in the past decade.Continue reading the main story\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisementContinue reading the main story\n\n''Without going as far as the act in question, is it not legitimate to want to react, become involved and oppose?''

From January 7 to January 9, a total of 17 people were killed in attacks on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a kosher grocery store, and the Paris suburb of Montrouge. Three suspects in the attacks were killed by police in separate standoffs. Facts:The Charlie Hebdo magazine began publishing in 1970 with the goal of satirizing religion, politics, and other topics. Most employees came from the publication Hara-Kiri, which was banned after it mocked the death of former President Charles de Gaulle. The Charlie in the title references Charlie Brown from the Peanuts cartoon. Hebdo is short for hebdomadaire, meaning weekly, in French.The magazine ceased publication in the 1980s due to lack of funds. It resumed publishing in 1992. In 2006, Charlie Hebdo reprinted controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that originally appearing in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. French President Jacques Chirac criticized the decision and called it \"overt provocation.\" Read MoreIn 2011, the magazine's offices were destroyed by a gasoline bomb after it published a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed. Profiles of the seventeen victims.The Suspects:Cherif Kouachi:-- Born in France, of Algerian descent. -- During his standoff with police, Cherif Kouachi told CNN affiliate BFMTV that he'd trained in Yemen with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). - He also told BFMTV that during that time he met with Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Muslim who was the face of AQAP until he was killed in 2011 in a U.S. drone strike.Said Kouachi:-- Born in France, of Algerian descent.-- Starting in 2009, Kouachi traveled to Yemen frequently, spending months at a time there. -- U.S officials said that in 2011 Kouachi received weapons training and worked with AQAP. Amedy Coulibaly:-- Born in France, of Senegalese descent.-- Arrested in 2010 for attempting to free an Algerian serving time for a 1995 subway bombing and spent some time in prison. Cherif Kouachi was under investigation for the same plot, but there was not enough evidence to indict him.- Before he was killed by police, Amedy Coulibaly purportedly told CNN affiliate BFMTV by phone that he belonged to ISIS.Hayat Boumeddiene:-- Born in France, of Algerian descent.-- Girlfriend of Amedy Coulibaly. -- Initially it was believed she took part in the shooting of a police woman in Montrouge and the subsequent kosher grocery store attack.-- However, a Turkish Prime Ministry source has told CNN that Boumeddiene entered Turkey on January 2, arriving at the Istanbul airport on a flight from Madrid with a man. She had a return ticket to Madrid for January 9, but she failed to take her return flight from Istanbul that day.-- Also, a French source close to the nation's security services said it's believed that Boumeddiene is no longer in France and she is thought to have left for Turkey, \"of course to reach Syria.\"-- Paris prosecutor Francois Molins has indicated Boumedienne and Cherif Kouachi's wife also were well acquainted, saying they exchanged 500 phone calls in 2014.Timeline of the attacks:January 7, 2015 - -- At approximately 11:30 a.m., gunmen force their way into the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris. The attackers allegedly say they are avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shout \"Allahu akbar,\" which translates to \"God is great,\" according to Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins.-- Twelve people are killed: Eight employees, a guest at the magazine, a maintenance worker and a police officer are killed. -- After fleeing the building, the gunmen encounter another police officer on the street and shoot him at point-blank range. -- Later in the day, the phrase \"Je Suis Charlie\" (\"I am Charlie\"), begins trending on social media. Thousands of Parisians take to the streets to hold a vigil for the victims. -- Hamyd Mourad, 18, turns himself into police after he is identified as the third suspect in the attacks. Police later clear Mourad of involvement, after numerous witnesses verify that he was at school during the time of the attacks. January 8, 2015 - -- Police name the prime suspects, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi. Police search for them in an area northeast of Paris, near Villers-Cotter\u00eats.-- One killed: A gunman dressed similarly to those in the Charlie Hebdo attack, all in black and wearing a bulletproof vest, shoots and kills a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. -- The Kouachi brothers steal food and gas from a gas station near Villers-Cotterets, according to a gas station attendant. --  A U.S. law enforcement official tells CNN both Kouachi brothers were in a  U.S.  database of known or suspected international terrorists known as TIDE and also were on the no-fly list and had been for years. -- In the evening, the Eiffel Tower briefly goes dark in remembrance of the victims. January 9, 2015 - -- Four people are killed: In the morning, police and French special forces troops surround a building in Dammartin-en-Goele, northeast of Paris, where the Kouachi brothers are hiding inside with one hostage. -- In the afternoon, a gunman enters a kosher grocery store in the Paris suburb of Porte de Vincennes, taking people hostage. The gunman is identified as Amedy Coulibaly. Police also link him to the attack in Montrouge. Also identified is his suspected accomplice, Hayat Boumeddiene. Officials say Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store. -- At approximately 5 p.m., police launch an assault on the building in Dammartin-en-Goele, where the Kouachi brothers are hiding. The brothers are killed. -- Shortly afterward, police launch an operation against Amedy Coulibaly at the kosher grocery store. Four hostages are killed, and fifteen are rescued. Coulibaly is also killed. January 11, 2015 - -- Across France, approximately 3.7 million people march in anti-terrorism rallies. In Paris, 40 world leaders, including French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and British Prime Minister David Cameron march with a crowd of 1.5 million people. US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are noticeably absent.January 13, 2015 - -- Funeral services are held in Israel for the four hostages killed in the kosher market. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends. -- French President Francois Hollande awards The Order of L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, France's highest honor, posthumously to the three slain police officers in the attacks, during a memorial ceremony at the Prefecture de Police in Paris. -- Bulgaria arrests Frenchman Fritz-Joly Joachin on a European arrest warrant, citing alleged ties to terrorists and a possible connection to the Kouachi brothers. January 14, 2015 - -- Charlie Hebdo releases a new edition of its magazine, featuring a cartoon of the Muslim prophet Mohammed on the cover, holding a sign that says \"Je suis Charlie.\" -- AQAP claims responsibility for the operation carried out on Charlie Hebdo. -- French security services identify a fourth man suspected of involvement in the Paris attacks, according to the French newspaper, Le Parisien.

Intelligence agents have been in a race against time to shut down clear and present threats to the personal security of several of the main candidates, reportedly most prominent among them Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the conservative candidate.\nTwo men were arrested in Marseille on Tuesday with guns and bomb materials, and were in the final stages of preparing \"several\" attacks, according \u00a0to French reports.\u00a0\nThe arrests coincided with a toughening of the discourse of Marine Le Pen, the far-Right Front National candidate, who gave her hardest-line speeches of the campaign in Paris on Monday and then again in Marseille on Wednesday night. In those she insisted that the past two administrations, both Left and Right, had failed to take the Islamist threat seriously.\nThe Paris terror attacks, she said, would not have occurred had she been in power as several of the assailants who killed 130 took the migrant route to enter the country illegally. She threatened to effectively shut French borders, promising to draft in army reservists to do so, placing a temporary \"moratorium\" on legal immigration and then only allowing 10,000 in a year after that.\nAlthough polls suggest Ms Le Pen is on track to come in the top two of Sunday's first round vote, along with centrist Emmanuel Macron, political analysts have suggested that Ms Le Pen has been losing steam in recent days and that her campaign has failed to capitalise on early leads.\u00a0\nShe will surely seek to claw back support after this latest attack by insisting that France requires a more authoritarian regime. She commands signifiant support from within the French police, which lost an officer on Thursday night.\n\nRead the full article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:02PM\n\n'War weapon' used in attack\n\n\n\nA French government spokesman says the Paris assailant used a \"war weapon\" to fire on officers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:00PM\n\n'Arrest warrant for second suspect who arrived by train from Belgium issued'\n\n\n\nPolice have issued an arrest warrant for a second suspect who arrived from Belgium by train, police sources have told Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo allegedly shows moment just after Champs Elysees shooting\n\n\n\n\n00:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:57PM\n\nPolice now state the second officer was not killed\n\n\n\nPierre-Henry Brandet, the interior ministry spokesman, has said one police officer was killed and two seriously wounded.

Intelligence agents have been in a race against time to shut down clear and present threats to the personal security of several of the main candidates, reportedly most prominent among them Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the conservative candidate.\nTwo men were arrested in Marseille on Tuesday with guns and bomb materials, and were in the final stages of preparing \"several\" attacks, according \u00a0to French reports.\u00a0\nThe arrests coincided with a toughening of the discourse of Marine Le Pen, the far-Right Front National candidate, who gave her hardest-line speeches of the campaign in Paris on Monday and then again in Marseille on Wednesday night. In those she insisted that the past two administrations, both Left and Right, had failed to take the Islamist threat seriously.\nThe Paris terror attacks, she said, would not have occurred had she been in power as several of the assailants who killed 130 took the migrant route to enter the country illegally. She threatened to effectively shut French borders, promising to draft in army reservists to do so, placing a temporary \"moratorium\" on legal immigration and then only allowing 10,000 in a year after that.\nAlthough polls suggest Ms Le Pen is on track to come in the top two of Sunday's first round vote, along with centrist Emmanuel Macron, political analysts have suggested that Ms Le Pen has been losing steam in recent days and that her campaign has failed to capitalise on early leads.\u00a0\nShe will surely seek to claw back support after this latest attack by insisting that France requires a more authoritarian regime.

Intelligence agents have been in a race against time to shut down clear and present threats to the personal security of several of the main candidates, reportedly most prominent among them Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the conservative candidate.\nTwo men were arrested in Marseille on Tuesday with guns and bomb materials, and were in the final stages of preparing \"several\" attacks, according \u00a0to French reports.\u00a0\nThe arrests coincided with a toughening of the discourse of Marine Le Pen, the far-Right Front National candidate, who gave her hardest-line speeches of the campaign in Paris on Monday and then again in Marseille on Wednesday night. In those she insisted that the past two administrations, both Left and Right, had failed to take the Islamist threat seriously.\nThe Paris terror attacks, she said, would not have occurred had she been in power as several of the assailants who killed 130 took the migrant route to enter the country illegally. She threatened to effectively shut French borders, promising to draft in army reservists to do so, placing a temporary \"moratorium\" on legal immigration and then only allowing 10,000 in a year after that.\nAlthough polls suggest Ms Le Pen is on track to come in the top two of Sunday's first round vote, along with centrist Emmanuel Macron, political analysts have suggested that Ms Le Pen has been losing steam in recent days and that her campaign has failed to capitalise on early leads.\u00a0\nShe will surely seek to claw back support after this latest attack by insisting that France requires a more authoritarian regime.

Ms Le Pen is to speak\u00a0at 10 am local time (0900 BST) and Mr Macron at midday (1100 BST). President Hollande is expected to speak after chairing a meeting of his security cabinet\u00a0beginning at 8am local time (0700 BST ).\nPolice searched the suspected gunman\u2019s home in the Paris suburb of Chelles overnight. His identity has been verified and confirmed by police and prosecutors but they do not want to make it public because they say they are still determining whether he acted alone or with accomplices wand do not want to compromise the investigation.\nHowever, he has been named as Karim Cheurfi, 39, a French national who was on the terrorist watch list and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2003 for the attempted murder of three men, including two policemen. The sentence was reduced to five years in 2005.\nOf the four leading candidates in the presidential election, which\u00a0 begins on Sunday with the first-round vote, Ms Le Pen and Mr Fillon have been campaigning strongly on law-and-order platforms, both promising to get tough on terrorism.\nMs Le Pen has said that if she is elected, she would deport all foreign nationals on the terrorism watch list. Mr Macron and the far-Left candidate, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, may struggle to convince voters of their security and defence credentials.\nMr Macron said in a tweet that, if elected, he would form an anti-Isil task force placed directly under the president's authority.\nAccording to the latest Elabe poll for BFM TV, taken just before the attack, Mr Macron pulled into the lead, on 24 per cent, well ahead of Ms Le Pen, on 21.5 per cent, Mr Fillon with 20 per cent, and Mr M\u00e9lenchon on 19.5 per cent.\nThe Front National did not achieve sustained boosts in popularity after previous attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:45AM\n\nLe Pen and\u00a0Fillon cancel plans\n\n\n\nDavid Chazan, in Paris, writes:\n\nMarine Le Pen and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon have cancelled their travel plans and will make statements later this morning.

Picavet/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images    \n\n \n\n\n\nThe winter months in Paris have a bad rap for being gloomy, dark, perpetually rainy and low-key, but with holiday festivities taking the city by storm for a good part of the season, Paris literally lights up more than ever. What's more, if you enjoy indoor activities such as visiting museums and cathedrals or spending a few hours reading peacefully in a traditional Parisian cafe while nursing a good cafe creme or chocolat chaud, or perhaps ice-skating in the open air, a winter sojourn in Paris may in fact be ideal for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy to Love It: The Pros Column Winter festivities and decorations bring a surreal magic to the city, making for especially picturesque evenings out with the whole family (and can serve as a romantic backdrop for couples, too). See details on holiday events by scrolling down. It's low season in Paris, meaning you'll have more of the city to yourself and won't have to compete with hordes of tourists for entry to exhibits, monuments or when making restaurant reservations. Not to mention the fact that air and train fares are lower than in peak season.And Now The Cons: The cold, often rainy conditions and short days can admittedly be a bit discouraging (Read related: Paris weather averages, month by month). You may find yourself spending more time indoors than you'd prefer when travelling. Certain attractions and monuments are closed during low season. I recommend checking opening dates and annual closures ahead of time to avoid disappointment.

Cet article est une r\u00e9\u00e9criture de l\u2019article 12 de la loi Maptam, cr\u00e9ant ce nouvel \u00e9tablissement public de coop\u00e9ration intercommunale (EPCI) \u00e0 fiscalit\u00e9 propre, englobant Paris, les 123 communes de petite couronne et pour l\u2019instant, deux villes de grande couronne :  Argenteuil (Val d\u2019Oise) et Paray-Vieille-Poste (Essonne), une liste qui n\u2019est pas encore stabilis\u00e9e, la loi Notre ayant rouvert un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un mois, \u00e0 partir de sa promulgation, pour permettre aux communes a\u00e9roportuaires de se prononcer.\nLa m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris (MGP) sera finalement dot\u00e9e d\u2019un conseil m\u00e9tropolitain d\u2019environ 210 \u00e9lus (209 \u00e0 ce jour), beaucoup plus resserr\u00e9 que dans les premi\u00e8res versions de la loi (pr\u00e8s de 350 membres), dont le si\u00e8ge sera situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris. Pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019effectif de ce conseil, comme le Premier ministre s\u2019y  \u00e9tait engag\u00e9 lors du comit\u00e9 interminist\u00e9riel d\u2019avril sur le Grand Paris, le gouvernement a   d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019aligner sa composition sur le droit applicable aux EPCI \u00e0 fiscalit\u00e9 propre.\n\nQuatre grandes comp\u00e9tences\n\u00a0\nLa MGP dispose de quatre grandes comp\u00e9tences : am\u00e9nagement de l\u2019espace m\u00e9tropolitain, politique locale de l\u2019habitat, d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique et protection de l\u2019air et de l\u2019environnement. Mais les deux premi\u00e8res comp\u00e9tences, sur proposition du gouvernement, ne lui seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9es que le 1er janvier 2017. Elle ne pourra donc pas s\u2019atteler formellement  \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration du sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale (Scot) avant cette date, ni \u00e0 celle du plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l\u2019habitat et de l\u2019h\u00e9bergement (PMHH). Elle pourra, en revanche, d\u00e8s 2016, engager l\u2019\u00e9laboration du plan climat air-\u00e9nergie territorial.  La m\u00e9tropole sera aussi charg\u00e9e de la mise en coh\u00e9rence des r\u00e9seaux de distribution d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, de gaz, de chaleur et de froid. Une commission consultative sera cr\u00e9\u00e9e avec la Ville de Paris et les syndicats intervenant en mati\u00e8re de gaz et d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\n\u00a0\nDeux ans pour d\u00e9finir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9tropolitain\n\nPar ailleurs, certaines comp\u00e9tences op\u00e9rationnelles (op\u00e9rations d\u2019am\u00e9nagement, constitution de r\u00e9serves fonci\u00e8res, zones d\u2019activit\u00e9\u2026.) ne seront exerc\u00e9es par la m\u00e9tropole que si elles sont reconnues d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9tropolitain. Dans l\u2019attente de la d\u00e9finition de cet int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9tropolitain \u2013avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2017- ou en l\u2019absence d\u2019un tel int\u00e9r\u00eat,  ces comp\u00e9tences seront exerc\u00e9es par les \u00e9tablissements publics territoriaux (EPT).\n\u00a0\nCarte des territoires\n\nLa m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris devrait en effet s\u2019organiser en douze \u00e9tablissements publics territoriaux (EPT), sans enclave et d\u2019au moins 300\u00a0000\u00a0habitants. Ces nouvelles entit\u00e9s, cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la loi, sont des EPCI sans fiscalit\u00e9 propre (sauf de 2016 \u00e0 2020 o\u00f9 ils percevront la Cotisation fonci\u00e8re des entreprises), soumis aux dispositions applicables aux syndicats de communes.\nAu moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 le Parlement votait le projet de loi Notre, le pr\u00e9fet de r\u00e9gion, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Carenco, pr\u00e9sentait aux \u00e9lus franciliens la carte des 12 futurs territoires envisag\u00e9s. Le projet de d\u00e9cret \u00e9tabli sur la base de cette carte sera soumis en octobre aux communes membres et le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre des territoires sera fix\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret en Conseil d\u2019Etat courant d\u00e9cembre 2015. La Ville de Paris constitue \u00e0 elle seule un EPT. Par ailleurs, trois communaut\u00e9s d\u2019agglom\u00e9ration existantes conservent leur p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre : Plaine Commune et Est Ensemble, en Seine-Saint-Denis ; Grand Paris Seine Ouest, dans les Hauts-de-Seine.  Il s\u2019agira donc pour elles d\u2019une simple transformation juridique et d\u2019une modification des flux financiers.  Pour la majorit\u00e9 des territoires, le processus de cr\u00e9ation sera plus compliqu\u00e9.\n\nAvis simple de la m\u00e9tropole sur les PLUI\n\nAu 1er janvier 2016, les EPT seront dot\u00e9s de l\u2019ensemble des comp\u00e9tences des EPCI pr\u00e9existants ainsi que de celles fix\u00e9es par la loi : politique de la ville; assainissement et eau ; gestion des d\u00e9chets et assimil\u00e9s. Deux autres  comp\u00e9tences sont soumises \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat territorial : \u00e9quipements culturels et sportifs et  action sociale. Les EPT devront \u00e9galement \u00e9laborer un plan climat air-\u00e9nergie, compatible avec celui de la m\u00e9tropole. Ils seront enfin charg\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un plan local d\u2019urbanisme intercommunal (PLUI) qui devra \u00eatre soumis pour avis simple \u00e0 la m\u00e9tropole. Ces PLUI devront \u00eatre compatibles avec le Scot m\u00e9tropolitain lorsqu\u2019il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, probablement courant 2018, et avec le PMHH, qui lui, pourrait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 courant 2017. A noter que le Scot comprendra un cahier de recommandations pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration des PLUI portant sur la pr\u00e9sentation du r\u00e8glement, l\u2019identification des cat\u00e9gories de zonage, les r\u00e8gles d\u2019urbanisme et les documents graphiques.\nComme la m\u00e9tropole, les territoires  disposent d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de deux ans, \u00e0 compter de leur cr\u00e9ation, pour d\u00e9finir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat territorial.\nPour aider \u00e0 la mise en place des EPT, la mission de pr\u00e9figuration de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des outils \u00e0 destination des administrations communales et intercommunales : un vade-mecum des EPT et une FAQ (Foire aux questions). A partir de septembre, elle devrait proposer aux \u00e9lus de participer \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e9unions qu\u2019ils jugeront n\u00e9cessaires et nommer des r\u00e9f\u00e9rents pour les territoires qui le souhaitent.\n\u00a0 En adoptant le projet de loi Notre, le 16 juillet, le Parlement a donn\u00e9 le feu vert \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris d\u00e8s le 1er janvier 2016.

Elle ne pourra donc pas s\u2019atteler formellement  \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration du sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale (Scot) avant cette date, ni \u00e0 celle du plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l\u2019habitat et de l\u2019h\u00e9bergement (PMHH). Elle pourra, en revanche, d\u00e8s 2016, engager l\u2019\u00e9laboration du plan climat air-\u00e9nergie territorial.  La m\u00e9tropole sera aussi charg\u00e9e de la mise en coh\u00e9rence des r\u00e9seaux de distribution d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, de gaz, de chaleur et de froid. Une commission consultative sera cr\u00e9\u00e9e avec la Ville de Paris et les syndicats intervenant en mati\u00e8re de gaz et d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\u00a0Deux ans pour d\u00e9finir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9tropolitain\nPar ailleurs, certaines comp\u00e9tences op\u00e9rationnelles (op\u00e9rations d\u2019am\u00e9nagement, constitution de r\u00e9serves fonci\u00e8res, zones d\u2019activit\u00e9\u2026.) ne seront exerc\u00e9es par la m\u00e9tropole que si elles sont reconnues d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9tropolitain. Dans l\u2019attente de la d\u00e9finition de cet int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00e9tropolitain \u2013avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2017- ou en l\u2019absence d\u2019un tel int\u00e9r\u00eat,  ces comp\u00e9tences seront exerc\u00e9es par les \u00e9tablissements publics territoriaux (EPT).\u00a0Carte des territoires\nLa m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris devrait en effet s\u2019organiser en douze \u00e9tablissements publics territoriaux (EPT), sans enclave et d\u2019au moins 300\u00a0000\u00a0habitants. Ces nouvelles entit\u00e9s, cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la loi, sont des EPCI sans fiscalit\u00e9 propre (sauf de 2016 \u00e0 2020 o\u00f9 ils percevront la Cotisation fonci\u00e8re des entreprises), soumis aux dispositions applicables aux syndicats de communes.Au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 le Parlement votait le projet de loi Notre, le pr\u00e9fet de r\u00e9gion, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Carenco, pr\u00e9sentait aux \u00e9lus franciliens la carte des 12 futurs territoires envisag\u00e9s. Le projet de d\u00e9cret \u00e9tabli sur la base de cette carte sera soumis en octobre aux communes membres et le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre des territoires sera fix\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret en Conseil d\u2019Etat courant d\u00e9cembre 2015. La Ville de Paris constitue \u00e0 elle seule un EPT. Par ailleurs, trois communaut\u00e9s d\u2019agglom\u00e9ration existantes conservent leur p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre : Plaine Commune et Est Ensemble, en Seine-Saint-Denis ; Grand Paris Seine Ouest, dans les Hauts-de-Seine.  Il s\u2019agira donc pour elles d\u2019une simple transformation juridique et d\u2019une modification des flux financiers.  Pour la majorit\u00e9 des territoires, le processus de cr\u00e9ation sera plus compliqu\u00e9.\nAvis simple de la m\u00e9tropole sur les PLUI\nAu 1er janvier 2016, les EPT seront dot\u00e9s de l\u2019ensemble des comp\u00e9tences des EPCI pr\u00e9existants ainsi que de celles fix\u00e9es par la loi : politique de la ville; assainissement et eau ; gestion des d\u00e9chets et assimil\u00e9s. Deux autres  comp\u00e9tences sont soumises \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat territorial : \u00e9quipements culturels et sportifs et  action sociale. Les EPT devront \u00e9galement \u00e9laborer un plan climat air-\u00e9nergie, compatible avec celui de la m\u00e9tropole. Ils seront enfin charg\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un plan local d\u2019urbanisme intercommunal (PLUI) qui devra \u00eatre soumis pour avis simple \u00e0 la m\u00e9tropole. Ces PLUI devront \u00eatre compatibles avec le Scot m\u00e9tropolitain lorsqu\u2019il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, probablement courant 2018, et avec le PMHH, qui lui, pourrait \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 courant 2017. A noter que le Scot comprendra un cahier de recommandations pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration des PLUI portant sur la pr\u00e9sentation du r\u00e8glement, l\u2019identification des cat\u00e9gories de zonage, les r\u00e8gles d\u2019urbanisme et les documents graphiques.Comme la m\u00e9tropole, les territoires  disposent d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de deux ans, \u00e0 compter de leur cr\u00e9ation, pour d\u00e9finir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat territorial.Pour aider \u00e0 la mise en place des EPT, la mission de pr\u00e9figuration de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des outils \u00e0 destination des administrations communales et intercommunales : un vade-mecum des EPT et une FAQ (Foire aux questions).

An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the \u2018Haussmann period\u2019. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789\u20132010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.IntroductionA city is a highly complex system where a large number of agents interact, leading to a dynamics seemingly difficult to understand. Many studies in history, geography, spatial economics, sociology, or physics discuss various facets of the evolution of the city1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. From a very general perspective, the large number and the diversity of agents operating simultaneously in a city suggest the intriguing possibility that cities are an emergent phenomenon ruled by self-organization2. On the other hand, the existence of central planning interventions might minimize the importance of self-organization in the course of evolution of cities. Central planning \u2013here understood as a top-down process controlled by a central authority \u2013 plays an important role in the city, leaving long standing traces, even if the time horizon of planners is limited and much smaller than the age of the city. One is thus confronted with the question of the possiblity of modelling a city and its expansion as a self-organized phenomenon. Indeed central planning could be thought of as an external perturbation, as if it were foreign to the self-organized development of a city. The recent digitization and georeferentiation of old maps will enable us to test quantitatively this effect, at least at the level of the structure of the road network. Such a transportation network is a crucial ingredient in cities as it allows individuals to work, transport and exchange goods, etc., and the evolution of this network reflects the evolution of the population and activity densities11,12. These network aspects were first studied in the 1960s in quantitative geography13, and in the last decade, complex networks theory has provided significant contributions to the quantitative characterization of urban street patterns14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.In this article, we will consider the case of the evolution of the street network of Paris over more than 200 years with a particular focus on the 19th century, period when Paris experienced large transformations under the guidance of Baron Haussmann24. It would be difficult to describe the social, political, and urbanistic importance and impact of Haussmann works in a few lines here and we refer the interested reader to the existing abundant literature on the subject (see25, and24 and references therein). Essentially, until the middle of the 19th century, central Paris has a medieval structure composed of many small and crowded streets, creating congestion and, according to some contemporaries, probably health problems. In 1852, Napoleon III commissioned Haussmann to modernize Paris by building safer streets, large avenues connected to the new train stations, central or symbolic squares (such as the famous place de l'Etoile, place de la Nation and place du Panth\u00e9on), improving the traffic flow and, last but not least, the circulation of army troops. Haussmann also built modern housing with uniform building heights, new water supply and sewer systems, new bridges, etc (see Fig. 1 where we show how dramatic the impact of Haussmann transformations are). The case of Paris under Haussmann provides an interesting example where changes due to central planning are very important and where a naive modelling is bound to fail. We analyze here in detail the effect of these planned transformations on the street network. By introducing physical quantitative measures associated with this network, we are able to compare the effect of the Hausmann transformation of the city with its \u2018natural\u2019 evolution over other periods.Figure 1: Illustration on a small area of the impact of Haussmann's transformations.On the yellow background, we show the parcel distribution before Haussmann (extracted from the Vasserot cadastre, 1808\u20131836), and in brown we show the new buildings delineating the new streets as designed by Haussmann and as they appeared in 1888. We can see on this example that the Haussmann plan implied a large number of destruction and rebuilding: approximately 28, 000 houses were destroyed and 100, 000 were built25 (figure created from authors' data with QuantumGIS software: www.qgis.org).Full size imageBy digitizing historical maps (for details on the sources used to construct the maps, see the Methods section) into a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment, we reconstruct the detailed road system (including minor streets) at six different moments in time, t = 1, 2, \u2026, 6, respectively corresponding to years: 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888, 1999, 2010. For each time, we constructed the associated primal graph Gt (see the Methods section and22,23), i.e. the graph where the nodes represent street junctions and the links correspond to road segments. In particular, it is important to note that we have thus snapshots of the street network before Haussmann works (1789\u20131836) and after (1888\u20132010). This allows us to study quantitatively the effect of such central planning.In Fig. 2(a), we display the map of Paris as it was in 1789 on top of the current map (2010). In order to use a single basis for comparison, we limited our study over time to the portion corresponding to 1789. We note here that the evolution of the outskirts and small villages in the surroundings has certainly an impact on the evolution of Paris and even if we focus here (mainly because of data availability reasons) on the structural modifications of the inner structure of Paris, a study at a larger scale will certainly be needed for capturing the whole picture of the evolution of this city. We then have 6 maps for different times and for the same area (of order 34\u2005km2). We also represent on Fig. 2(b), the new streets created during the Haussmann period which covers roughly the second half of the 19th century. Even if we observe some evolution outside of this portion, most of the Haussmann works are comprised within this portion.Figure 2(a) Map of Paris in 1789 superimposed on the map of current 2010 Paris.In the whole study, we focus on the Haussmann modifications and limited ourselves to the 1789 portion of the street network. (b) Map of Haussmann modifications. The grey lines represent the road network in 1836, the green lines represent the Haussmann modifications which are basically all contained in the 1789 area (figure created from authors' data with ArcGiS 10.0 (ESRI): www.esri.com/software/arcgis/).Full size imageResultsSimple measuresIn the following we will study the structure of the graph Gt at different times t (see the Methods section for precise definitions), having in mind that our goal is to identify the most important quantitative signatures of central planning during the evolution of this road network.First basic measures include the evolution of the number of nodes N, edges E, and total length Ltot of the networks (restricted to the area corresponding to 1789). In Fig. 3 we show the results for these indicators which display a clear acceleration during the Haussmann period (1836\u20131888). The number of nodes increased from about 3000 in 1836 to about 6000 in 1888 and the total length increase from about 400\u2005kms to almost 700\u2005kms, all this in about 50 years. It is interesting to note that this node increase corresponds essentially to an important increase in the population. In particular, we note (see the Supplementary Information for more details) that the number of nodes N is proportional to the population P and that the corresponding increase rate is of order dN/dP \u2248 0.0021, similar to what was measured in a previous study about a completely different area23. The rapid increase of nodes during the Haussmann period is thus largely due to demographic pressure. Now, if we want to exclude exogeneous effects and focus on the structure of networks, we can plot the various indicators such as the number of edges and the total length versus the number of nodes taken as a time clock. The results shown Fig. 3(d\u2013f) display a smoother behavior. In particular, E is a linear function of N, demonstrating that the average degree is essentially constant \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3.0 since 1789. The total length versus N also displays a smooth behavior consistent with a perturbed lattice22. Indeed, if the segment length \u21131 is roughly constant and equal to  where \u03c1 = N/A is the density of nodes (A is the area considered here), we then obtain for the total length A fit of the type  is shown in Fig. 3(d) and the value of a measured gives an estimate of the area , in agreement with the actual value A = 33.6\u2005km2 (for the 1789 portion). This agreement demonstrates that all the networks at different times are not far from a perturbed lattice.Figure 3Top panels: Number of (a) nodes, (b) total length (kms), and (c) rescaled average route distance versus time.Bottom panels: Number of (d) edges, (e) total length (kms), and (f) the rescaled average route distance versus the number of nodes N. In (d) the dashed (blue) line is a linear fit with slope 1.55 (r2 = 0.99) consistent with constant average degree of order \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3, and in (e) the dashed (green) line a square root fit of the form  with a = 8.44\u2005kms (r2 = 0.99). Based on a perturbed lattice picture this gives an area equal to  consistent with the actual value (A = 33.6\u2005km2). In (f), we show the rescaled average shortest route versus N which decreases showing that the denser the network and the easier it is to navigate from one node to the other (if delays at junctions are neglected).Full size imageWe also plot the average route distance dR defined as the average over all pairs of nodes of the shortest route between them (see Methods for more details). For a two dimensional spatial network, we expect this quantity to scale as  and thus increases with N. The ratio  is thus better suited to measure the efficiency of the network and we observe (Fig. 3(c,f)) that it decreases with time and N. This result simply demonstrate that if we neglect delays at junctions, it becomes easier to navigate in the network as it gets denser.Typology of new linksWe can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4). In23, the distribution of this quantity displays two peaks which corresponds to two types of links belonging to two distinct processes: densification and exploration23. We first observe (see Figure 2 of SI) that in the first period, the majority of new links are of the E2 type and correspond to construction of new streets with new nodes. We see that the Haussmann transition period (1836\u20131888) is not particularly different from the other previous periods. In the modern period (after 1999), E0 becomes dominant and consistent with the idea of a mature street network where densification dominates the evolution of the urban tissue. Obviously, this is also an effect of limiting ourselves to the 1789 portion: in a wider area, many new roads were created and both densification and exploration coexist. We note here that the structure of the street network of central Paris remained remarkably stable from 1888 until now (and in this period also, densification was the main process in this area).We then plot the distribution of this quantity \u03b4 for the different transition periods and the result is shown in Fig. 4. These figures show that for all periods most new links belong to the densification process with a small peak of exploration in the period 1836\u20131888. In well-developed, mature systems, it is expected that densification is the dominant growth mechanism. Here also, we see that the Haussmann period is not significantly different from previous periods.Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageEvolution of the spatial distribution of centralityThe betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26. In our case where we consider a limited portion of a spatial network, two important effects need to be taken into consideration. First, as we consider a portion, only paths within this portion are taken into account in the calculation of the BC and this usually does not reflect the reality of the actual origin-destination matrix. In particular, flows with the exterior of the portion and surrounding villages are not taken into account. As a result, the BC will be able to detect important routes and nodes in the internal structure of the network but will miss large-scale communication roads such as a north-south or a East-West road connecting the portion with the surroundings of Paris. In23, the scale of the network was large enough so that the BC could recover important central roads such as Roman streets. The BC in the present case has then to be used as a structural probe of the network, enabling us to track the important modifications. The second point concerns the spatial distribution of the BC which will be important in the following. For a lattice the most central nodes (see the discussion in22 for example) are close to the barycenter of the nodes: spatial centrality and betweenness centrality are then usually strongly correlated. In16 and17 it is shown that the most central points display interesting spatial structures which still need to be understood, but which represent an important signature of the networks' topology.We first consider the time evolution of the node betweenness centrality (with similar results for the edge BC). In the SI (see figure 3 of SI), we show the distribution of the node BC at different times. Apart from the fact that the average BC varies, we see that the tail of the distribution remains constant in time, showing that the statistics of very central nodes is not modified. From this point of view, the evolution of the road network follows a smooth behavior, even in the Haussmann period.So far, most of the measures indicate that the evolution of the street network follows simple densification and exploration rules and is very similar to other areas studied23. At this point, it appears that Haussmann works didn't change radically the structure of the city. However, we can suspect that Haussmann's impact is very important on congestion and traffic and should therefore be seen on the spatial distribution of centrality. In the figure 5, we show the maps of Paris at different times and we indicate the most central nodes (such that their centrality gv(i) is larger than max gv/\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 10 see the SI, for a discussion on the effect of the value of \u03b1). We can clearly see here that the spatial distribution of the BC is not stable, displays large variations, and is not uniformly distributed over the Paris area (we represented here the node centrality, and similar results are obtained for the edge centrality, see the SI for plots for the edge centrality and more details). In particular, we see that between 1836 and 1888, the Haussmann works had a dramatical impact on the spatial structure of the centrality, especially near the heart of Paris. Central roads usually persist in time23,27, but in our case, the Haussmann reorganization was acting precisely at this level by redistributing the shortest paths which had certainly an impact on congestion inside the city. After Haussmann we observe a large stability of the network until nowadays.Figure 5: Spatial distribution of the most central nodes (with centrality gv such that gv > max gv/10).We observe for the different periods important reorganizations of the spatial distribution of centrality, corresponding to different specific interventions. In particular, we observe a very important redistribution of centrality during the Haussmann period with the appearance of a reticulated structure on the 1888 map.Full size imageIt is interesting to note that these maps also provide details about the evolution of the road network of Paris during other periods which seems to reflect what happened in reality and which we can relate to specific local interventions. For example, in the period 1789\u20131826 between the French Revolution and the Napoleonic empire, the maps shown in Fig. 5 display large variations with redistribution of central nodes which probably reflects the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads, improving congestion inside Paris. During the period 1826\u20131836 which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the the July Monarchy, the maps in Fig. 5 suggests an important reorganization on the east side of Paris. This seems to correspond very well to the creation during that period of a new channel in this area (the channel \u2018Saint Martin\u2019) which triggered many transformations in the eastern part of the network.In order to analyse the spatial redistribution effect more quantitatively, we compute various quantities inside a disk of radius r centered on the barycenter of all nodes (which stays approximately at the same location in time). We first study the number of nodes N(r) (Fig. 6), its variation \u03b4N(r) between t and t + 1, and the number of central nodes (such that gv(i) > max gv/10). We see that the largest variation of the number of nodes (see Fig. 6b) is indeed in the Haussmann period 1836\u20131888, especially for distance r > 1,500 meters. More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836). As a result, visually clear in Fig. 5, there is a large concentration of centrality in the center of Paris until 1836 at least. The natural consequence of this concentration is that the center of Paris was very probably very congested at that time. In this respect, what happens under the Haussmann supervision is natural as he acts on the spatial organization of centrality. We see indeed that in 1888, the most central nodes form a more reticulated structure excluding concentration of centrality. A structure which remained stable until now. Interestingly, we note that Haussmann's new roads and avenues represent approximately 6% of the total length only (compared to nowadays network), which is a small fraction, considered that it has a very important impact on the centrality spatial organization.Figure 6: Top panels: (a) number of nodes in a disk of radius r from the barycenter of Paris and (b) its variation versus r.As expected the largest variation occurred during the Haussmann period. Bottom panels: (c) Number of nodes at distance r and with centrality larger than g0 (g0 = max gv/10) and (d) its variation. The thick green line in the right panels indicate the Haussmann transition 1836\u20131888. We see here that during the Haussmann period (and also in the 1789\u20131826 period), there is a large decrease of the number of central nodes in the central region of Paris (r < 2,000 meters).Full size imageThis reorganization of centrality was undertaken with creation of new roads and avenues destroying parts of the original pattern (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(b)) resulting in the modification of the geometrical structure of blocks (defined here as the faces of the planar street network). The effect of Haussmann modifications on the geometrical structure of blocks can be quantitatively measured by the distribution of the shape factor \u03d5 (see Methods) shown in Fig. 7. We see that before the Haussmann modifications, the distribution of \u03d5 is stable and is essentially centered around \u03d5 = 0.5 which corresponds to rectangles. From 1888, the distribution is however much flatter showing a larger diversity of shapes. In particular, we see that for small values of \u03d5 < 0.25 there is an important increase of P(\u03d5) demonstrating an abundance of elongated shapes (triangles and rectangles mostly) created by Haussmann's works. These effects can be confirmed by observing the angle distribution of roads shown on Fig. 8 where we represent on a polar plot r(\u03b8) = P(\u03b8) with P(\u03b8) the probability that a road segment makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line. Before Haussmann's modifications, the distribution has two clear peaks corresponding to perpendicular streets and in 1888 we indeed observe a more uniform distribution with a large proportion of various angles such as diagonals.Figure 7: Probability distribution of the \u03d5 shape factor for the blocks at different years.Until 1836, this distribution is stable and we observe a dramatical change during the Haussmann period with a larger abundance of blocks with small value of \u03d5. These small values correspond to elongated rectangle or triangles created by streets crossing the existing geometry at various angles.Full size imageFigure 8: Radial representation of the angle distribution of road segments for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888.The radial distance r in this plot represents the probability to observe a street with angle \u03b8: r = P(\u03b8) with \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] and P(\u03b8) is the probability to observe an oriented road with angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line (see first panel, top left). Until 1836, the distribution is peaked around two values separated by approximately 90 degrees and in 1888, we observe an important fraction of diagonals and other lines at intermediate angles.Full size imageDiscussionIn this paper, we have studied the evolution of the street network of the city of Paris. This case is particularly interesting as Paris experienced large modifications in the 19th century (the Haussmann period) allowing us to try to quantity the effect of central planning. Our results for central Paris reveal that most indicators follow a smooth evolution, dominated by a densification process, despite the important perturbation that happened during Haussmann. In our results, the important quantitative signature of central planning is the spatial reorganization of the most central nodes, in contrast with other regions where self-organization dominated and which didn't experience such a large-scale structure modification. This structural reorganization was obtained by the creation at a large scale of new roads and avenues (and the destruction of older roads) which do not follow the constraints of the existing geometry. These new roads do not follow the densification/exploration process but appear at various angles and intersect with many other existing roads.While the natural, self-organized evolution of roads seems in general to be local in space, the Haussmann modifications happen during a relatively short time and at a large spatial scale by connecting important nodes which are far away in the network. Following the Haussmann interventions, the natural processes take over on the modified substrate. It is unclear at this stage if Haussmann modifications were optimal and more importantly, if they were at a certain point inevitable and would have happened anyway (due to the high level of congestion for example). More work, with more data on a larger spatial scale are probably needed to study these important questions.MethodsTemporal network dataWe denote by Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) the obtained primal graph at time t, where Vt and Et are respectively the set of nodes and links at time t. The number of nodes at time t is then N(t) = |Vt| and the number of links is E(t) = |Et|. Using common definitions, we thus have Vt = Vt\u22121 \u222a \u0394Vt and Et = Et\u22121 \u222a \u0394Et, where \u0394Vt and \u0394Et are respectively the new street junctions and the new streets added in time ]t \u2212 1, t] to the network existing at time t \u2212 1.The networks for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888 are extracted from the following maps:1789: Map of the city of Paris with its new enclosure. Geometrically based on the \u2018meridienne de l'Observatoire\u2019 and surveyed by Edm\u00e9 Verniquet. Achieved in 1791.1826: Road map of Paris surveyed by Charles Picquet, geographer for the King and the duke of Orl\u00e9ans.1836: Cadastre of Paris, Philibert Vasserot. Map constructed according blocks and classified according to old districts. 24 Atlas, 1810\u20131836.1888: Atlas of the 20 districts of Paris, surveyed by M. Alphand, and L. Fauve, under the administration of the prefect E. Poubelle, Paris, 1888.All these maps were digitized at the LaD\u00e9HiS under the supervision of Maurizio Gribaudi, in the framework of a research on the social and architectural transformations of parisian neighborhoods between the 18th and 19th centuries. The network (and the block structure of figure 1) extracted from the Vasserot cadastre was initiated by Anne-Laure Bethe for the program Alpage28.The networks of 1999 and 2010 are coming from the french Geographical National Institute (IGN) on the basis of modern surveys.Average route distanceFor a network, the shortest path between two nodes is defined as the path with the minimum number of links connecting the two nodes. For spatial networks, it makes more sense to weight the links with their length: to each edge e we thus associate a weight de defined as the euclidean length of e. We can then compute the length  of a path P The shortest weighted path is then the one with the minimum total length. The average shortest weighted path is also called the average route distance dR. It indicates on average how many kilometers you have to walk from one point to the other in this spatial network. For a two dimensional network, it is expected22 that it scales as for a network of size N. In order to compare networks with different numbers of nodes N, it is then natural to compare the rescaled average route distance .Betweenness centrality, impactThe nature of the growth process can be quantitatively characterised by looking at the centrality of streets. Among the various centrality indices available for spatial networks we use here the betweenness centrality (BC)15,17,26, which is one of the measures of centrality commonly adopted to quantify the importance of a node or a link in a graph. Given the graph Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) at time t, the BC of a link e is defined as: where \u03c3ij is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j, while \u03c3ij(e) is the number of such shortest paths which contain the link e. The quantity g(e) essentially measures the number of times a link is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network. The BC of a node is defined in a similar way where \u03c3st(i) denotes here the number of shortest path from node s to t going through the node i.In order to evaluate the impact of a new link on the overall distribution of the betweenness centrality we use the betweenness centrality impact defined in23. In the graph at time t, we first compute the average betweenness centrality of all the links of Gt as: where g(e) is the betweenness centrality of the edge e in the graph Gt. Then, for each link e* \u2208 \u0394Et, i.e. for each newly added link in the time window ]t \u2212 1, t] we consider the new graph obtained by removing the link e* from Gt and we denote this graph as Gt\\{e*}. We compute again the average edge betweenness centrality, this time for the graph Gt\\{e*}. Finally, the impact \u03b4(e*) of edge e* on the betweenness centrality of the network at time t is defined as The BC impact is thus the relative variation of the graph average betweenness due to the removal of the link e*.Form factorThe shape or form factor \u03d5 of blocks is defined as the ratio of the area of the block and the area of the circumscribed circle of diameter D (see16,22) The more anisotropic the block and the smaller the factor \u03d5.Change historyUpdated online 12 November 2013A correction has been published and is appended to both the HTML and PDF versions of this paper.

An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the \u2018Haussmann period\u2019. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789\u20132010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.IntroductionA city is a highly complex system where a large number of agents interact, leading to a dynamics seemingly difficult to understand. Many studies in history, geography, spatial economics, sociology, or physics discuss various facets of the evolution of the city1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. From a very general perspective, the large number and the diversity of agents operating simultaneously in a city suggest the intriguing possibility that cities are an emergent phenomenon ruled by self-organization2. On the other hand, the existence of central planning interventions might minimize the importance of self-organization in the course of evolution of cities. Central planning \u2013here understood as a top-down process controlled by a central authority \u2013 plays an important role in the city, leaving long standing traces, even if the time horizon of planners is limited and much smaller than the age of the city. One is thus confronted with the question of the possiblity of modelling a city and its expansion as a self-organized phenomenon. Indeed central planning could be thought of as an external perturbation, as if it were foreign to the self-organized development of a city. The recent digitization and georeferentiation of old maps will enable us to test quantitatively this effect, at least at the level of the structure of the road network. Such a transportation network is a crucial ingredient in cities as it allows individuals to work, transport and exchange goods, etc., and the evolution of this network reflects the evolution of the population and activity densities11,12. These network aspects were first studied in the 1960s in quantitative geography13, and in the last decade, complex networks theory has provided significant contributions to the quantitative characterization of urban street patterns14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.In this article, we will consider the case of the evolution of the street network of Paris over more than 200 years with a particular focus on the 19th century, period when Paris experienced large transformations under the guidance of Baron Haussmann24. It would be difficult to describe the social, political, and urbanistic importance and impact of Haussmann works in a few lines here and we refer the interested reader to the existing abundant literature on the subject (see25, and24 and references therein). Essentially, until the middle of the 19th century, central Paris has a medieval structure composed of many small and crowded streets, creating congestion and, according to some contemporaries, probably health problems. In 1852, Napoleon III commissioned Haussmann to modernize Paris by building safer streets, large avenues connected to the new train stations, central or symbolic squares (such as the famous place de l'Etoile, place de la Nation and place du Panth\u00e9on), improving the traffic flow and, last but not least, the circulation of army troops. Haussmann also built modern housing with uniform building heights, new water supply and sewer systems, new bridges, etc (see Fig. 1 where we show how dramatic the impact of Haussmann transformations are). The case of Paris under Haussmann provides an interesting example where changes due to central planning are very important and where a naive modelling is bound to fail. We analyze here in detail the effect of these planned transformations on the street network. By introducing physical quantitative measures associated with this network, we are able to compare the effect of the Hausmann transformation of the city with its \u2018natural\u2019 evolution over other periods.Figure 1: Illustration on a small area of the impact of Haussmann's transformations.On the yellow background, we show the parcel distribution before Haussmann (extracted from the Vasserot cadastre, 1808\u20131836), and in brown we show the new buildings delineating the new streets as designed by Haussmann and as they appeared in 1888. We can see on this example that the Haussmann plan implied a large number of destruction and rebuilding: approximately 28, 000 houses were destroyed and 100, 000 were built25 (figure created from authors' data with QuantumGIS software: www.qgis.org).Full size imageBy digitizing historical maps (for details on the sources used to construct the maps, see the Methods section) into a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment, we reconstruct the detailed road system (including minor streets) at six different moments in time, t = 1, 2, \u2026, 6, respectively corresponding to years: 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888, 1999, 2010. For each time, we constructed the associated primal graph Gt (see the Methods section and22,23), i.e. the graph where the nodes represent street junctions and the links correspond to road segments. In particular, it is important to note that we have thus snapshots of the street network before Haussmann works (1789\u20131836) and after (1888\u20132010). This allows us to study quantitatively the effect of such central planning.In Fig. 2(a), we display the map of Paris as it was in 1789 on top of the current map (2010). In order to use a single basis for comparison, we limited our study over time to the portion corresponding to 1789. We note here that the evolution of the outskirts and small villages in the surroundings has certainly an impact on the evolution of Paris and even if we focus here (mainly because of data availability reasons) on the structural modifications of the inner structure of Paris, a study at a larger scale will certainly be needed for capturing the whole picture of the evolution of this city. We then have 6 maps for different times and for the same area (of order 34\u2005km2). We also represent on Fig. 2(b), the new streets created during the Haussmann period which covers roughly the second half of the 19th century. Even if we observe some evolution outside of this portion, most of the Haussmann works are comprised within this portion.Figure 2(a) Map of Paris in 1789 superimposed on the map of current 2010 Paris.In the whole study, we focus on the Haussmann modifications and limited ourselves to the 1789 portion of the street network. (b) Map of Haussmann modifications. The grey lines represent the road network in 1836, the green lines represent the Haussmann modifications which are basically all contained in the 1789 area (figure created from authors' data with ArcGiS 10.0 (ESRI): www.esri.com/software/arcgis/).Full size imageResultsSimple measuresIn the following we will study the structure of the graph Gt at different times t (see the Methods section for precise definitions), having in mind that our goal is to identify the most important quantitative signatures of central planning during the evolution of this road network.First basic measures include the evolution of the number of nodes N, edges E, and total length Ltot of the networks (restricted to the area corresponding to 1789). In Fig. 3 we show the results for these indicators which display a clear acceleration during the Haussmann period (1836\u20131888). The number of nodes increased from about 3000 in 1836 to about 6000 in 1888 and the total length increase from about 400\u2005kms to almost 700\u2005kms, all this in about 50 years. It is interesting to note that this node increase corresponds essentially to an important increase in the population. In particular, we note (see the Supplementary Information for more details) that the number of nodes N is proportional to the population P and that the corresponding increase rate is of order dN/dP \u2248 0.0021, similar to what was measured in a previous study about a completely different area23. The rapid increase of nodes during the Haussmann period is thus largely due to demographic pressure. Now, if we want to exclude exogeneous effects and focus on the structure of networks, we can plot the various indicators such as the number of edges and the total length versus the number of nodes taken as a time clock. The results shown Fig. 3(d\u2013f) display a smoother behavior. In particular, E is a linear function of N, demonstrating that the average degree is essentially constant \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3.0 since 1789. The total length versus N also displays a smooth behavior consistent with a perturbed lattice22. Indeed, if the segment length \u21131 is roughly constant and equal to  where \u03c1 = N/A is the density of nodes (A is the area considered here), we then obtain for the total length A fit of the type  is shown in Fig. 3(d) and the value of a measured gives an estimate of the area , in agreement with the actual value A = 33.6\u2005km2 (for the 1789 portion). This agreement demonstrates that all the networks at different times are not far from a perturbed lattice.Figure 3Top panels: Number of (a) nodes, (b) total length (kms), and (c) rescaled average route distance versus time.Bottom panels: Number of (d) edges, (e) total length (kms), and (f) the rescaled average route distance versus the number of nodes N. In (d) the dashed (blue) line is a linear fit with slope 1.55 (r2 = 0.99) consistent with constant average degree of order \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3, and in (e) the dashed (green) line a square root fit of the form  with a = 8.44\u2005kms (r2 = 0.99). Based on a perturbed lattice picture this gives an area equal to  consistent with the actual value (A = 33.6\u2005km2). In (f), we show the rescaled average shortest route versus N which decreases showing that the denser the network and the easier it is to navigate from one node to the other (if delays at junctions are neglected).Full size imageWe also plot the average route distance dR defined as the average over all pairs of nodes of the shortest route between them (see Methods for more details). For a two dimensional spatial network, we expect this quantity to scale as  and thus increases with N. The ratio  is thus better suited to measure the efficiency of the network and we observe (Fig. 3(c,f)) that it decreases with time and N. This result simply demonstrate that if we neglect delays at junctions, it becomes easier to navigate in the network as it gets denser.Typology of new linksWe can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4). In23, the distribution of this quantity displays two peaks which corresponds to two types of links belonging to two distinct processes: densification and exploration23. We first observe (see Figure 2 of SI) that in the first period, the majority of new links are of the E2 type and correspond to construction of new streets with new nodes. We see that the Haussmann transition period (1836\u20131888) is not particularly different from the other previous periods. In the modern period (after 1999), E0 becomes dominant and consistent with the idea of a mature street network where densification dominates the evolution of the urban tissue. Obviously, this is also an effect of limiting ourselves to the 1789 portion: in a wider area, many new roads were created and both densification and exploration coexist. We note here that the structure of the street network of central Paris remained remarkably stable from 1888 until now (and in this period also, densification was the main process in this area).We then plot the distribution of this quantity \u03b4 for the different transition periods and the result is shown in Fig. 4. These figures show that for all periods most new links belong to the densification process with a small peak of exploration in the period 1836\u20131888. In well-developed, mature systems, it is expected that densification is the dominant growth mechanism. Here also, we see that the Haussmann period is not significantly different from previous periods.Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageEvolution of the spatial distribution of centralityThe betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26. In our case where we consider a limited portion of a spatial network, two important effects need to be taken into consideration. First, as we consider a portion, only paths within this portion are taken into account in the calculation of the BC and this usually does not reflect the reality of the actual origin-destination matrix. In particular, flows with the exterior of the portion and surrounding villages are not taken into account. As a result, the BC will be able to detect important routes and nodes in the internal structure of the network but will miss large-scale communication roads such as a north-south or a East-West road connecting the portion with the surroundings of Paris. In23, the scale of the network was large enough so that the BC could recover important central roads such as Roman streets. The BC in the present case has then to be used as a structural probe of the network, enabling us to track the important modifications. The second point concerns the spatial distribution of the BC which will be important in the following. For a lattice the most central nodes (see the discussion in22 for example) are close to the barycenter of the nodes: spatial centrality and betweenness centrality are then usually strongly correlated. In16 and17 it is shown that the most central points display interesting spatial structures which still need to be understood, but which represent an important signature of the networks' topology.We first consider the time evolution of the node betweenness centrality (with similar results for the edge BC). In the SI (see figure 3 of SI), we show the distribution of the node BC at different times. Apart from the fact that the average BC varies, we see that the tail of the distribution remains constant in time, showing that the statistics of very central nodes is not modified. From this point of view, the evolution of the road network follows a smooth behavior, even in the Haussmann period.So far, most of the measures indicate that the evolution of the street network follows simple densification and exploration rules and is very similar to other areas studied23. At this point, it appears that Haussmann works didn't change radically the structure of the city. However, we can suspect that Haussmann's impact is very important on congestion and traffic and should therefore be seen on the spatial distribution of centrality. In the figure 5, we show the maps of Paris at different times and we indicate the most central nodes (such that their centrality gv(i) is larger than max gv/\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 10 see the SI, for a discussion on the effect of the value of \u03b1). We can clearly see here that the spatial distribution of the BC is not stable, displays large variations, and is not uniformly distributed over the Paris area (we represented here the node centrality, and similar results are obtained for the edge centrality, see the SI for plots for the edge centrality and more details). In particular, we see that between 1836 and 1888, the Haussmann works had a dramatical impact on the spatial structure of the centrality, especially near the heart of Paris. Central roads usually persist in time23,27, but in our case, the Haussmann reorganization was acting precisely at this level by redistributing the shortest paths which had certainly an impact on congestion inside the city. After Haussmann we observe a large stability of the network until nowadays.Figure 5: Spatial distribution of the most central nodes (with centrality gv such that gv > max gv/10).We observe for the different periods important reorganizations of the spatial distribution of centrality, corresponding to different specific interventions. In particular, we observe a very important redistribution of centrality during the Haussmann period with the appearance of a reticulated structure on the 1888 map.Full size imageIt is interesting to note that these maps also provide details about the evolution of the road network of Paris during other periods which seems to reflect what happened in reality and which we can relate to specific local interventions. For example, in the period 1789\u20131826 between the French Revolution and the Napoleonic empire, the maps shown in Fig. 5 display large variations with redistribution of central nodes which probably reflects the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads, improving congestion inside Paris. During the period 1826\u20131836 which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the the July Monarchy, the maps in Fig. 5 suggests an important reorganization on the east side of Paris. This seems to correspond very well to the creation during that period of a new channel in this area (the channel \u2018Saint Martin\u2019) which triggered many transformations in the eastern part of the network.In order to analyse the spatial redistribution effect more quantitatively, we compute various quantities inside a disk of radius r centered on the barycenter of all nodes (which stays approximately at the same location in time). We first study the number of nodes N(r) (Fig. 6), its variation \u03b4N(r) between t and t + 1, and the number of central nodes (such that gv(i) > max gv/10). We see that the largest variation of the number of nodes (see Fig. 6b) is indeed in the Haussmann period 1836\u20131888, especially for distance r > 1,500 meters. More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836). As a result, visually clear in Fig. 5, there is a large concentration of centrality in the center of Paris until 1836 at least. The natural consequence of this concentration is that the center of Paris was very probably very congested at that time. In this respect, what happens under the Haussmann supervision is natural as he acts on the spatial organization of centrality. We see indeed that in 1888, the most central nodes form a more reticulated structure excluding concentration of centrality. A structure which remained stable until now. Interestingly, we note that Haussmann's new roads and avenues represent approximately 6% of the total length only (compared to nowadays network), which is a small fraction, considered that it has a very important impact on the centrality spatial organization.Figure 6: Top panels: (a) number of nodes in a disk of radius r from the barycenter of Paris and (b) its variation versus r.As expected the largest variation occurred during the Haussmann period. Bottom panels: (c) Number of nodes at distance r and with centrality larger than g0 (g0 = max gv/10) and (d) its variation. The thick green line in the right panels indicate the Haussmann transition 1836\u20131888. We see here that during the Haussmann period (and also in the 1789\u20131826 period), there is a large decrease of the number of central nodes in the central region of Paris (r < 2,000 meters).Full size imageThis reorganization of centrality was undertaken with creation of new roads and avenues destroying parts of the original pattern (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(b)) resulting in the modification of the geometrical structure of blocks (defined here as the faces of the planar street network). The effect of Haussmann modifications on the geometrical structure of blocks can be quantitatively measured by the distribution of the shape factor \u03d5 (see Methods) shown in Fig. 7. We see that before the Haussmann modifications, the distribution of \u03d5 is stable and is essentially centered around \u03d5 = 0.5 which corresponds to rectangles. From 1888, the distribution is however much flatter showing a larger diversity of shapes. In particular, we see that for small values of \u03d5 < 0.25 there is an important increase of P(\u03d5) demonstrating an abundance of elongated shapes (triangles and rectangles mostly) created by Haussmann's works. These effects can be confirmed by observing the angle distribution of roads shown on Fig. 8 where we represent on a polar plot r(\u03b8) = P(\u03b8) with P(\u03b8) the probability that a road segment makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line. Before Haussmann's modifications, the distribution has two clear peaks corresponding to perpendicular streets and in 1888 we indeed observe a more uniform distribution with a large proportion of various angles such as diagonals.Figure 7: Probability distribution of the \u03d5 shape factor for the blocks at different years.Until 1836, this distribution is stable and we observe a dramatical change during the Haussmann period with a larger abundance of blocks with small value of \u03d5. These small values correspond to elongated rectangle or triangles created by streets crossing the existing geometry at various angles.Full size imageFigure 8: Radial representation of the angle distribution of road segments for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888.The radial distance r in this plot represents the probability to observe a street with angle \u03b8: r = P(\u03b8) with \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] and P(\u03b8) is the probability to observe an oriented road with angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line (see first panel, top left). Until 1836, the distribution is peaked around two values separated by approximately 90 degrees and in 1888, we observe an important fraction of diagonals and other lines at intermediate angles.Full size imageDiscussionIn this paper, we have studied the evolution of the street network of the city of Paris. This case is particularly interesting as Paris experienced large modifications in the 19th century (the Haussmann period) allowing us to try to quantity the effect of central planning. Our results for central Paris reveal that most indicators follow a smooth evolution, dominated by a densification process, despite the important perturbation that happened during Haussmann. In our results, the important quantitative signature of central planning is the spatial reorganization of the most central nodes, in contrast with other regions where self-organization dominated and which didn't experience such a large-scale structure modification. This structural reorganization was obtained by the creation at a large scale of new roads and avenues (and the destruction of older roads) which do not follow the constraints of the existing geometry. These new roads do not follow the densification/exploration process but appear at various angles and intersect with many other existing roads.While the natural, self-organized evolution of roads seems in general to be local in space, the Haussmann modifications happen during a relatively short time and at a large spatial scale by connecting important nodes which are far away in the network. Following the Haussmann interventions, the natural processes take over on the modified substrate. It is unclear at this stage if Haussmann modifications were optimal and more importantly, if they were at a certain point inevitable and would have happened anyway (due to the high level of congestion for example). More work, with more data on a larger spatial scale are probably needed to study these important questions.MethodsTemporal network dataWe denote by Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) the obtained primal graph at time t, where Vt and Et are respectively the set of nodes and links at time t. The number of nodes at time t is then N(t) = |Vt| and the number of links is E(t) = |Et|. Using common definitions, we thus have Vt = Vt\u22121 \u222a \u0394Vt and Et = Et\u22121 \u222a \u0394Et, where \u0394Vt and \u0394Et are respectively the new street junctions and the new streets added in time ]t \u2212 1, t] to the network existing at time t \u2212 1.The networks for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888 are extracted from the following maps:1789: Map of the city of Paris with its new enclosure. Geometrically based on the \u2018meridienne de l'Observatoire\u2019 and surveyed by Edm\u00e9 Verniquet. Achieved in 1791.1826: Road map of Paris surveyed by Charles Picquet, geographer for the King and the duke of Orl\u00e9ans.1836: Cadastre of Paris, Philibert Vasserot. Map constructed according blocks and classified according to old districts. 24 Atlas, 1810\u20131836.1888: Atlas of the 20 districts of Paris, surveyed by M. Alphand, and L. Fauve, under the administration of the prefect E. Poubelle, Paris, 1888.All these maps were digitized at the LaD\u00e9HiS under the supervision of Maurizio Gribaudi, in the framework of a research on the social and architectural transformations of parisian neighborhoods between the 18th and 19th centuries. The network (and the block structure of figure 1) extracted from the Vasserot cadastre was initiated by Anne-Laure Bethe for the program Alpage28.The networks of 1999 and 2010 are coming from the french Geographical National Institute (IGN) on the basis of modern surveys.Average route distanceFor a network, the shortest path between two nodes is defined as the path with the minimum number of links connecting the two nodes. For spatial networks, it makes more sense to weight the links with their length: to each edge e we thus associate a weight de defined as the euclidean length of e. We can then compute the length  of a path P The shortest weighted path is then the one with the minimum total length. The average shortest weighted path is also called the average route distance dR. It indicates on average how many kilometers you have to walk from one point to the other in this spatial network. For a two dimensional network, it is expected22 that it scales as for a network of size N. In order to compare networks with different numbers of nodes N, it is then natural to compare the rescaled average route distance .Betweenness centrality, impactThe nature of the growth process can be quantitatively characterised by looking at the centrality of streets. Among the various centrality indices available for spatial networks we use here the betweenness centrality (BC)15,17,26, which is one of the measures of centrality commonly adopted to quantify the importance of a node or a link in a graph. Given the graph Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) at time t, the BC of a link e is defined as: where \u03c3ij is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j, while \u03c3ij(e) is the number of such shortest paths which contain the link e. The quantity g(e) essentially measures the number of times a link is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network. The BC of a node is defined in a similar way where \u03c3st(i) denotes here the number of shortest path from node s to t going through the node i.In order to evaluate the impact of a new link on the overall distribution of the betweenness centrality we use the betweenness centrality impact defined in23. In the graph at time t, we first compute the average betweenness centrality of all the links of Gt as: where g(e) is the betweenness centrality of the edge e in the graph Gt. Then, for each link e* \u2208 \u0394Et, i.e. for each newly added link in the time window ]t \u2212 1, t] we consider the new graph obtained by removing the link e* from Gt and we denote this graph as Gt\\{e*}. We compute again the average edge betweenness centrality, this time for the graph Gt\\{e*}. Finally, the impact \u03b4(e*) of edge e* on the betweenness centrality of the network at time t is defined as The BC impact is thus the relative variation of the graph average betweenness due to the removal of the link e*.Form factorThe shape or form factor \u03d5 of blocks is defined as the ratio of the area of the block and the area of the circumscribed circle of diameter D (see16,22) The more anisotropic the block and the smaller the factor \u03d5.Change historyUpdated online 12 November 2013A correction has been published and is appended to both the HTML and PDF versions of this paper.

We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.IntroductionA city is a highly complex system where a large number of agents interact, leading to a dynamics seemingly difficult to understand. Many studies in history, geography, spatial economics, sociology, or physics discuss various facets of the evolution of the city1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. From a very general perspective, the large number and the diversity of agents operating simultaneously in a city suggest the intriguing possibility that cities are an emergent phenomenon ruled by self-organization2. On the other hand, the existence of central planning interventions might minimize the importance of self-organization in the course of evolution of cities. Central planning \u2013here understood as a top-down process controlled by a central authority \u2013 plays an important role in the city, leaving long standing traces, even if the time horizon of planners is limited and much smaller than the age of the city. One is thus confronted with the question of the possiblity of modelling a city and its expansion as a self-organized phenomenon. Indeed central planning could be thought of as an external perturbation, as if it were foreign to the self-organized development of a city. The recent digitization and georeferentiation of old maps will enable us to test quantitatively this effect, at least at the level of the structure of the road network. Such a transportation network is a crucial ingredient in cities as it allows individuals to work, transport and exchange goods, etc., and the evolution of this network reflects the evolution of the population and activity densities11,12. These network aspects were first studied in the 1960s in quantitative geography13, and in the last decade, complex networks theory has provided significant contributions to the quantitative characterization of urban street patterns14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.In this article, we will consider the case of the evolution of the street network of Paris over more than 200 years with a particular focus on the 19th century, period when Paris experienced large transformations under the guidance of Baron Haussmann24. It would be difficult to describe the social, political, and urbanistic importance and impact of Haussmann works in a few lines here and we refer the interested reader to the existing abundant literature on the subject (see25, and24 and references therein). Essentially, until the middle of the 19th century, central Paris has a medieval structure composed of many small and crowded streets, creating congestion and, according to some contemporaries, probably health problems. In 1852, Napoleon III commissioned Haussmann to modernize Paris by building safer streets, large avenues connected to the new train stations, central or symbolic squares (such as the famous place de l'Etoile, place de la Nation and place du Panth\u00e9on), improving the traffic flow and, last but not least, the circulation of army troops. Haussmann also built modern housing with uniform building heights, new water supply and sewer systems, new bridges, etc (see Fig. 1 where we show how dramatic the impact of Haussmann transformations are). The case of Paris under Haussmann provides an interesting example where changes due to central planning are very important and where a naive modelling is bound to fail. We analyze here in detail the effect of these planned transformations on the street network. By introducing physical quantitative measures associated with this network, we are able to compare the effect of the Hausmann transformation of the city with its \u2018natural\u2019 evolution over other periods.Figure 1: Illustration on a small area of the impact of Haussmann's transformations.On the yellow background, we show the parcel distribution before Haussmann (extracted from the Vasserot cadastre, 1808\u20131836), and in brown we show the new buildings delineating the new streets as designed by Haussmann and as they appeared in 1888. We can see on this example that the Haussmann plan implied a large number of destruction and rebuilding: approximately 28, 000 houses were destroyed and 100, 000 were built25 (figure created from authors' data with QuantumGIS software: www.qgis.org).Full size imageBy digitizing historical maps (for details on the sources used to construct the maps, see the Methods section) into a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment, we reconstruct the detailed road system (including minor streets) at six different moments in time, t = 1, 2, \u2026, 6, respectively corresponding to years: 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888, 1999, 2010. For each time, we constructed the associated primal graph Gt (see the Methods section and22,23), i.e. the graph where the nodes represent street junctions and the links correspond to road segments. In particular, it is important to note that we have thus snapshots of the street network before Haussmann works (1789\u20131836) and after (1888\u20132010). This allows us to study quantitatively the effect of such central planning.In Fig. 2(a), we display the map of Paris as it was in 1789 on top of the current map (2010). In order to use a single basis for comparison, we limited our study over time to the portion corresponding to 1789. We note here that the evolution of the outskirts and small villages in the surroundings has certainly an impact on the evolution of Paris and even if we focus here (mainly because of data availability reasons) on the structural modifications of the inner structure of Paris, a study at a larger scale will certainly be needed for capturing the whole picture of the evolution of this city. We then have 6 maps for different times and for the same area (of order 34\u2005km2). We also represent on Fig. 2(b), the new streets created during the Haussmann period which covers roughly the second half of the 19th century. Even if we observe some evolution outside of this portion, most of the Haussmann works are comprised within this portion.Figure 2(a) Map of Paris in 1789 superimposed on the map of current 2010 Paris.In the whole study, we focus on the Haussmann modifications and limited ourselves to the 1789 portion of the street network.

In Fig. 3 we show the results for these indicators which display a clear acceleration during the Haussmann period (1836\u20131888). The number of nodes increased from about 3000 in 1836 to about 6000 in 1888 and the total length increase from about 400\u2005kms to almost 700\u2005kms, all this in about 50 years. It is interesting to note that this node increase corresponds essentially to an important increase in the population. In particular, we note (see the Supplementary Information for more details) that the number of nodes N is proportional to the population P and that the corresponding increase rate is of order dN/dP \u2248 0.0021, similar to what was measured in a previous study about a completely different area23. The rapid increase of nodes during the Haussmann period is thus largely due to demographic pressure. Now, if we want to exclude exogeneous effects and focus on the structure of networks, we can plot the various indicators such as the number of edges and the total length versus the number of nodes taken as a time clock. The results shown Fig. 3(d\u2013f) display a smoother behavior. In particular, E is a linear function of N, demonstrating that the average degree is essentially constant \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3.0 since 1789. The total length versus N also displays a smooth behavior consistent with a perturbed lattice22. Indeed, if the segment length \u21131 is roughly constant and equal to  where \u03c1 = N/A is the density of nodes (A is the area considered here), we then obtain for the total length A fit of the type  is shown in Fig. 3(d) and the value of a measured gives an estimate of the area , in agreement with the actual value A = 33.6\u2005km2 (for the 1789 portion). This agreement demonstrates that all the networks at different times are not far from a perturbed lattice.Figure 3Top panels: Number of (a) nodes, (b) total length (kms), and (c) rescaled average route distance versus time.Bottom panels: Number of (d) edges, (e) total length (kms), and (f) the rescaled average route distance versus the number of nodes N. In (d) the dashed (blue) line is a linear fit with slope 1.55 (r2 = 0.99) consistent with constant average degree of order \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3, and in (e) the dashed (green) line a square root fit of the form  with a = 8.44\u2005kms (r2 = 0.99). Based on a perturbed lattice picture this gives an area equal to  consistent with the actual value (A = 33.6\u2005km2). In (f), we show the rescaled average shortest route versus N which decreases showing that the denser the network and the easier it is to navigate from one node to the other (if delays at junctions are neglected).Full size imageWe also plot the average route distance dR defined as the average over all pairs of nodes of the shortest route between them (see Methods for more details). For a two dimensional spatial network, we expect this quantity to scale as  and thus increases with N. The ratio  is thus better suited to measure the efficiency of the network and we observe (Fig. 3(c,f)) that it decreases with time and N. This result simply demonstrate that if we neglect delays at junctions, it becomes easier to navigate in the network as it gets denser.Typology of new linksWe can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4). In23, the distribution of this quantity displays two peaks which corresponds to two types of links belonging to two distinct processes: densification and exploration23. We first observe (see Figure 2 of SI) that in the first period, the majority of new links are of the E2 type and correspond to construction of new streets with new nodes. We see that the Haussmann transition period (1836\u20131888) is not particularly different from the other previous periods. In the modern period (after 1999), E0 becomes dominant and consistent with the idea of a mature street network where densification dominates the evolution of the urban tissue. Obviously, this is also an effect of limiting ourselves to the 1789 portion: in a wider area, many new roads were created and both densification and exploration coexist. We note here that the structure of the street network of central Paris remained remarkably stable from 1888 until now (and in this period also, densification was the main process in this area).We then plot the distribution of this quantity \u03b4 for the different transition periods and the result is shown in Fig. 4. These figures show that for all periods most new links belong to the densification process with a small peak of exploration in the period 1836\u20131888. In well-developed, mature systems, it is expected that densification is the dominant growth mechanism. Here also, we see that the Haussmann period is not significantly different from previous periods.Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageEvolution of the spatial distribution of centralityThe betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26. In our case where we consider a limited portion of a spatial network, two important effects need to be taken into consideration. First, as we consider a portion, only paths within this portion are taken into account in the calculation of the BC and this usually does not reflect the reality of the actual origin-destination matrix. In particular, flows with the exterior of the portion and surrounding villages are not taken into account. As a result, the BC will be able to detect important routes and nodes in the internal structure of the network but will miss large-scale communication roads such as a north-south or a East-West road connecting the portion with the surroundings of Paris. In23, the scale of the network was large enough so that the BC could recover important central roads such as Roman streets. The BC in the present case has then to be used as a structural probe of the network, enabling us to track the important modifications. The second point concerns the spatial distribution of the BC which will be important in the following. For a lattice the most central nodes (see the discussion in22 for example) are close to the barycenter of the nodes: spatial centrality and betweenness centrality are then usually strongly correlated. In16 and17 it is shown that the most central points display interesting spatial structures which still need to be understood, but which represent an important signature of the networks' topology.We first consider the time evolution of the node betweenness centrality (with similar results for the edge BC). In the SI (see figure 3 of SI), we show the distribution of the node BC at different times. Apart from the fact that the average BC varies, we see that the tail of the distribution remains constant in time, showing that the statistics of very central nodes is not modified. From this point of view, the evolution of the road network follows a smooth behavior, even in the Haussmann period.So far, most of the measures indicate that the evolution of the street network follows simple densification and exploration rules and is very similar to other areas studied23. At this point, it appears that Haussmann works didn't change radically the structure of the city. However, we can suspect that Haussmann's impact is very important on congestion and traffic and should therefore be seen on the spatial distribution of centrality. In the figure 5, we show the maps of Paris at different times and we indicate the most central nodes (such that their centrality gv(i) is larger than max gv/\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 10 see the SI, for a discussion on the effect of the value of \u03b1). We can clearly see here that the spatial distribution of the BC is not stable, displays large variations, and is not uniformly distributed over the Paris area (we represented here the node centrality, and similar results are obtained for the edge centrality, see the SI for plots for the edge centrality and more details). In particular, we see that between 1836 and 1888, the Haussmann works had a dramatical impact on the spatial structure of the centrality, especially near the heart of Paris. Central roads usually persist in time23,27, but in our case, the Haussmann reorganization was acting precisely at this level by redistributing the shortest paths which had certainly an impact on congestion inside the city. After Haussmann we observe a large stability of the network until nowadays.Figure 5: Spatial distribution of the most central nodes (with centrality gv such that gv > max gv/10).We observe for the different periods important reorganizations of the spatial distribution of centrality, corresponding to different specific interventions. In particular, we observe a very important redistribution of centrality during the Haussmann period with the appearance of a reticulated structure on the 1888 map.Full size imageIt is interesting to note that these maps also provide details about the evolution of the road network of Paris during other periods which seems to reflect what happened in reality and which we can relate to specific local interventions. For example, in the period 1789\u20131826 between the French Revolution and the Napoleonic empire, the maps shown in Fig. 5 display large variations with redistribution of central nodes which probably reflects the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads, improving congestion inside Paris. During the period 1826\u20131836 which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the the July Monarchy, the maps in Fig. 5 suggests an important reorganization on the east side of Paris. This seems to correspond very well to the creation during that period of a new channel in this area (the channel \u2018Saint Martin\u2019) which triggered many transformations in the eastern part of the network.In order to analyse the spatial redistribution effect more quantitatively, we compute various quantities inside a disk of radius r centered on the barycenter of all nodes (which stays approximately at the same location in time). We first study the number of nodes N(r) (Fig. 6), its variation \u03b4N(r) between t and t + 1, and the number of central nodes (such that gv(i) > max gv/10). We see that the largest variation of the number of nodes (see Fig. 6b) is indeed in the Haussmann period 1836\u20131888, especially for distance r > 1,500 meters. More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836). As a result, visually clear in Fig. 5, there is a large concentration of centrality in the center of Paris until 1836 at least. The natural consequence of this concentration is that the center of Paris was very probably very congested at that time. In this respect, what happens under the Haussmann supervision is natural as he acts on the spatial organization of centrality. We see indeed that in 1888, the most central nodes form a more reticulated structure excluding concentration of centrality. A structure which remained stable until now. Interestingly, we note that Haussmann's new roads and avenues represent approximately 6% of the total length only (compared to nowadays network), which is a small fraction, considered that it has a very important impact on the centrality spatial organization.Figure 6: Top panels: (a) number of nodes in a disk of radius r from the barycenter of Paris and (b) its variation versus r.As expected the largest variation occurred during the Haussmann period. Bottom panels: (c) Number of nodes at distance r and with centrality larger than g0 (g0 = max gv/10) and (d) its variation. The thick green line in the right panels indicate the Haussmann transition 1836\u20131888. We see here that during the Haussmann period (and also in the 1789\u20131826 period), there is a large decrease of the number of central nodes in the central region of Paris (r < 2,000 meters).Full size imageThis reorganization of centrality was undertaken with creation of new roads and avenues destroying parts of the original pattern (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(b)) resulting in the modification of the geometrical structure of blocks (defined here as the faces of the planar street network). The effect of Haussmann modifications on the geometrical structure of blocks can be quantitatively measured by the distribution of the shape factor \u03d5 (see Methods) shown in Fig. 7. We see that before the Haussmann modifications, the distribution of \u03d5 is stable and is essentially centered around \u03d5 = 0.5 which corresponds to rectangles. From 1888, the distribution is however much flatter showing a larger diversity of shapes. In particular, we see that for small values of \u03d5 < 0.25 there is an important increase of P(\u03d5) demonstrating an abundance of elongated shapes (triangles and rectangles mostly) created by Haussmann's works. These effects can be confirmed by observing the angle distribution of roads shown on Fig. 8 where we represent on a polar plot r(\u03b8) = P(\u03b8) with P(\u03b8) the probability that a road segment makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line. Before Haussmann's modifications, the distribution has two clear peaks corresponding to perpendicular streets and in 1888 we indeed observe a more uniform distribution with a large proportion of various angles such as diagonals.Figure 7: Probability distribution of the \u03d5 shape factor for the blocks at different years.Until 1836, this distribution is stable and we observe a dramatical change during the Haussmann period with a larger abundance of blocks with small value of \u03d5. These small values correspond to elongated rectangle or triangles created by streets crossing the existing geometry at various angles.Full size imageFigure 8: Radial representation of the angle distribution of road segments for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888.The radial distance r in this plot represents the probability to observe a street with angle \u03b8: r = P(\u03b8) with \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] and P(\u03b8) is the probability to observe an oriented road with angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line (see first panel, top left). Until 1836, the distribution is peaked around two values separated by approximately 90 degrees and in 1888, we observe an important fraction of diagonals and other lines at intermediate angles.Full size imageResultsSimple measuresIn the following we will study the structure of the graph Gt at different times t (see the Methods section for precise definitions), having in mind that our goal is to identify the most important quantitative signatures of central planning during the evolution of this road network.First basic measures include the evolution of the number of nodes N, edges E, and total length Ltot of the networks (restricted to the area corresponding to 1789). In Fig. 3 we show the results for these indicators which display a clear acceleration during the Haussmann period (1836\u20131888). The number of nodes increased from about 3000 in 1836 to about 6000 in 1888 and the total length increase from about 400\u2005kms to almost 700\u2005kms, all this in about 50 years. It is interesting to note that this node increase corresponds essentially to an important increase in the population. In particular, we note (see the Supplementary Information for more details) that the number of nodes N is proportional to the population P and that the corresponding increase rate is of order dN/dP \u2248 0.0021, similar to what was measured in a previous study about a completely different area23. The rapid increase of nodes during the Haussmann period is thus largely due to demographic pressure. Now, if we want to exclude exogeneous effects and focus on the structure of networks, we can plot the various indicators such as the number of edges and the total length versus the number of nodes taken as a time clock. The results shown Fig. 3(d\u2013f) display a smoother behavior. In particular, E is a linear function of N, demonstrating that the average degree is essentially constant \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3.0 since 1789. The total length versus N also displays a smooth behavior consistent with a perturbed lattice22. Indeed, if the segment length \u21131 is roughly constant and equal to  where \u03c1 = N/A is the density of nodes (A is the area considered here), we then obtain for the total length A fit of the type  is shown in Fig. 3(d) and the value of a measured gives an estimate of the area , in agreement with the actual value A = 33.6\u2005km2 (for the 1789 portion). This agreement demonstrates that all the networks at different times are not far from a perturbed lattice.Figure 3Top panels: Number of (a) nodes, (b) total length (kms), and (c) rescaled average route distance versus time.Bottom panels: Number of (d) edges, (e) total length (kms), and (f) the rescaled average route distance versus the number of nodes N. In (d) the dashed (blue) line is a linear fit with slope 1.55 (r2 = 0.99) consistent with constant average degree of order \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3, and in (e) the dashed (green) line a square root fit of the form  with a = 8.44\u2005kms (r2 = 0.99). Based on a perturbed lattice picture this gives an area equal to  consistent with the actual value (A = 33.6\u2005km2). In (f), we show the rescaled average shortest route versus N which decreases showing that the denser the network and the easier it is to navigate from one node to the other (if delays at junctions are neglected).Full size imageWe also plot the average route distance dR defined as the average over all pairs of nodes of the shortest route between them (see Methods for more details). For a two dimensional spatial network, we expect this quantity to scale as  and thus increases with N. The ratio  is thus better suited to measure the efficiency of the network and we observe (Fig. 3(c,f)) that it decreases with time and N. This result simply demonstrate that if we neglect delays at junctions, it becomes easier to navigate in the network as it gets denser.Typology of new linksWe can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4).

These figures show that for all periods most new links belong to the densification process with a small peak of exploration in the period 1836\u20131888. In well-developed, mature systems, it is expected that densification is the dominant growth mechanism. Here also, we see that the Haussmann period is not significantly different from previous periods.Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageEvolution of the spatial distribution of centralityThe betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26.

More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836).

In Fig. 3 we show the results for these indicators which display a clear acceleration during the Haussmann period (1836\u20131888). The number of nodes increased from about 3000 in 1836 to about 6000 in 1888 and the total length increase from about 400\u2005kms to almost 700\u2005kms, all this in about 50 years.

In particular, E is a linear function of N, demonstrating that the average degree is essentially constant \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3.0 since 1789. The total length versus N also displays a smooth behavior consistent with a perturbed lattice22. Indeed, if the segment length \u21131 is roughly constant and equal to  where \u03c1 = N/A is the density of nodes (A is the area considered here), we then obtain for the total length A fit of the type  is shown in Fig. 3(d) and the value of a measured gives an estimate of the area , in agreement with the actual value A = 33.6\u2005km2 (for the 1789 portion). This agreement demonstrates that all the networks at different times are not far from a perturbed lattice.Figure 3Top panels: Number of (a) nodes, (b) total length (kms), and (c) rescaled average route distance versus time.Bottom panels: Number of (d) edges, (e) total length (kms), and (f) the rescaled average route distance versus the number of nodes N. In (d) the dashed (blue) line is a linear fit with slope 1.55 (r2 = 0.99) consistent with constant average degree of order \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3, and in (e) the dashed (green) line a square root fit of the form  with a = 8.44\u2005kms (r2 = 0.99). Based on a perturbed lattice picture this gives an area equal to  consistent with the actual value (A = 33.6\u2005km2). In (f), we show the rescaled average shortest route versus N which decreases showing that the denser the network and the easier it is to navigate from one node to the other (if delays at junctions are neglected).Full size imageWe also plot the average route distance dR defined as the average over all pairs of nodes of the shortest route between them (see Methods for more details). For a two dimensional spatial network, we expect this quantity to scale as  and thus increases with N. The ratio  is thus better suited to measure the efficiency of the network and we observe (Fig. 3(c,f)) that it decreases with time and N. This result simply demonstrate that if we neglect delays at junctions, it becomes easier to navigate in the network as it gets denser.Typology of new linksWe can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4). In23, the distribution of this quantity displays two peaks which corresponds to two types of links belonging to two distinct processes: densification and exploration23. We first observe (see Figure 2 of SI) that in the first period, the majority of new links are of the E2 type and correspond to construction of new streets with new nodes. We see that the Haussmann transition period (1836\u20131888) is not particularly different from the other previous periods. In the modern period (after 1999), E0 becomes dominant and consistent with the idea of a mature street network where densification dominates the evolution of the urban tissue. Obviously, this is also an effect of limiting ourselves to the 1789 portion: in a wider area, many new roads were created and both densification and exploration coexist. We note here that the structure of the street network of central Paris remained remarkably stable from 1888 until now (and in this period also, densification was the main process in this area).We then plot the distribution of this quantity \u03b4 for the different transition periods and the result is shown in Fig. 4. These figures show that for all periods most new links belong to the densification process with a small peak of exploration in the period 1836\u20131888. In well-developed, mature systems, it is expected that densification is the dominant growth mechanism. Here also, we see that the Haussmann period is not significantly different from previous periods.Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageEvolution of the spatial distribution of centralityThe betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26. In our case where we consider a limited portion of a spatial network, two important effects need to be taken into consideration. First, as we consider a portion, only paths within this portion are taken into account in the calculation of the BC and this usually does not reflect the reality of the actual origin-destination matrix. In particular, flows with the exterior of the portion and surrounding villages are not taken into account. As a result, the BC will be able to detect important routes and nodes in the internal structure of the network but will miss large-scale communication roads such as a north-south or a East-West road connecting the portion with the surroundings of Paris. In23, the scale of the network was large enough so that the BC could recover important central roads such as Roman streets. The BC in the present case has then to be used as a structural probe of the network, enabling us to track the important modifications. The second point concerns the spatial distribution of the BC which will be important in the following. For a lattice the most central nodes (see the discussion in22 for example) are close to the barycenter of the nodes: spatial centrality and betweenness centrality are then usually strongly correlated. In16 and17 it is shown that the most central points display interesting spatial structures which still need to be understood, but which represent an important signature of the networks' topology.We first consider the time evolution of the node betweenness centrality (with similar results for the edge BC). In the SI (see figure 3 of SI), we show the distribution of the node BC at different times. Apart from the fact that the average BC varies, we see that the tail of the distribution remains constant in time, showing that the statistics of very central nodes is not modified. From this point of view, the evolution of the road network follows a smooth behavior, even in the Haussmann period.So far, most of the measures indicate that the evolution of the street network follows simple densification and exploration rules and is very similar to other areas studied23. At this point, it appears that Haussmann works didn't change radically the structure of the city. However, we can suspect that Haussmann's impact is very important on congestion and traffic and should therefore be seen on the spatial distribution of centrality. In the figure 5, we show the maps of Paris at different times and we indicate the most central nodes (such that their centrality gv(i) is larger than max gv/\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 10 see the SI, for a discussion on the effect of the value of \u03b1). We can clearly see here that the spatial distribution of the BC is not stable, displays large variations, and is not uniformly distributed over the Paris area (we represented here the node centrality, and similar results are obtained for the edge centrality, see the SI for plots for the edge centrality and more details). In particular, we see that between 1836 and 1888, the Haussmann works had a dramatical impact on the spatial structure of the centrality, especially near the heart of Paris. Central roads usually persist in time23,27, but in our case, the Haussmann reorganization was acting precisely at this level by redistributing the shortest paths which had certainly an impact on congestion inside the city. After Haussmann we observe a large stability of the network until nowadays.Figure 5: Spatial distribution of the most central nodes (with centrality gv such that gv > max gv/10).We observe for the different periods important reorganizations of the spatial distribution of centrality, corresponding to different specific interventions. In particular, we observe a very important redistribution of centrality during the Haussmann period with the appearance of a reticulated structure on the 1888 map.Full size imageIt is interesting to note that these maps also provide details about the evolution of the road network of Paris during other periods which seems to reflect what happened in reality and which we can relate to specific local interventions. For example, in the period 1789\u20131826 between the French Revolution and the Napoleonic empire, the maps shown in Fig. 5 display large variations with redistribution of central nodes which probably reflects the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads, improving congestion inside Paris. During the period 1826\u20131836 which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the the July Monarchy, the maps in Fig. 5 suggests an important reorganization on the east side of Paris. This seems to correspond very well to the creation during that period of a new channel in this area (the channel \u2018Saint Martin\u2019) which triggered many transformations in the eastern part of the network.In order to analyse the spatial redistribution effect more quantitatively, we compute various quantities inside a disk of radius r centered on the barycenter of all nodes (which stays approximately at the same location in time). We first study the number of nodes N(r) (Fig. 6), its variation \u03b4N(r) between t and t + 1, and the number of central nodes (such that gv(i) > max gv/10). We see that the largest variation of the number of nodes (see Fig. 6b) is indeed in the Haussmann period 1836\u20131888, especially for distance r > 1,500 meters. More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836). As a result, visually clear in Fig. 5, there is a large concentration of centrality in the center of Paris until 1836 at least. The natural consequence of this concentration is that the center of Paris was very probably very congested at that time. In this respect, what happens under the Haussmann supervision is natural as he acts on the spatial organization of centrality. We see indeed that in 1888, the most central nodes form a more reticulated structure excluding concentration of centrality. A structure which remained stable until now. Interestingly, we note that Haussmann's new roads and avenues represent approximately 6% of the total length only (compared to nowadays network), which is a small fraction, considered that it has a very important impact on the centrality spatial organization.Figure 6: Top panels: (a) number of nodes in a disk of radius r from the barycenter of Paris and (b) its variation versus r.As expected the largest variation occurred during the Haussmann period. Bottom panels: (c) Number of nodes at distance r and with centrality larger than g0 (g0 = max gv/10) and (d) its variation. The thick green line in the right panels indicate the Haussmann transition 1836\u20131888. We see here that during the Haussmann period (and also in the 1789\u20131826 period), there is a large decrease of the number of central nodes in the central region of Paris (r < 2,000 meters).Full size imageThis reorganization of centrality was undertaken with creation of new roads and avenues destroying parts of the original pattern (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(b)) resulting in the modification of the geometrical structure of blocks (defined here as the faces of the planar street network). The effect of Haussmann modifications on the geometrical structure of blocks can be quantitatively measured by the distribution of the shape factor \u03d5 (see Methods) shown in Fig. 7. We see that before the Haussmann modifications, the distribution of \u03d5 is stable and is essentially centered around \u03d5 = 0.5 which corresponds to rectangles. From 1888, the distribution is however much flatter showing a larger diversity of shapes. In particular, we see that for small values of \u03d5 < 0.25 there is an important increase of P(\u03d5) demonstrating an abundance of elongated shapes (triangles and rectangles mostly) created by Haussmann's works. These effects can be confirmed by observing the angle distribution of roads shown on Fig. 8 where we represent on a polar plot r(\u03b8) = P(\u03b8) with P(\u03b8) the probability that a road segment makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line. Before Haussmann's modifications, the distribution has two clear peaks corresponding to perpendicular streets and in 1888 we indeed observe a more uniform distribution with a large proportion of various angles such as diagonals.Figure 7: Probability distribution of the \u03d5 shape factor for the blocks at different years.Until 1836, this distribution is stable and we observe a dramatical change during the Haussmann period with a larger abundance of blocks with small value of \u03d5. These small values correspond to elongated rectangle or triangles created by streets crossing the existing geometry at various angles.Full size imageFigure 8: Radial representation of the angle distribution of road segments for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888.The radial distance r in this plot represents the probability to observe a street with angle \u03b8: r = P(\u03b8) with \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] and P(\u03b8) is the probability to observe an oriented road with angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line (see first panel, top left). Until 1836, the distribution is peaked around two values separated by approximately 90 degrees and in 1888, we observe an important fraction of diagonals and other lines at intermediate angles.Full size imageSimple measuresIn the following we will study the structure of the graph Gt at different times t (see the Methods section for precise definitions), having in mind that our goal is to identify the most important quantitative signatures of central planning during the evolution of this road network.GtttFirst basic measures include the evolution of the number of nodes N, edges E, and total length Ltot of the networks (restricted to the area corresponding to 1789). In Fig. 3 we show the results for these indicators which display a clear acceleration during the Haussmann period (1836\u20131888). The number of nodes increased from about 3000 in 1836 to about 6000 in 1888 and the total length increase from about 400\u2005kms to almost 700\u2005kms, all this in about 50 years. It is interesting to note that this node increase corresponds essentially to an important increase in the population. In particular, we note (see the Supplementary Information for more details) that the number of nodes N is proportional to the population P and that the corresponding increase rate is of order dN/dP \u2248 0.0021, similar to what was measured in a previous study about a completely different area23. The rapid increase of nodes during the Haussmann period is thus largely due to demographic pressure. Now, if we want to exclude exogeneous effects and focus on the structure of networks, we can plot the various indicators such as the number of edges and the total length versus the number of nodes taken as a time clock. The results shown Fig. 3(d\u2013f) display a smoother behavior. In particular, E is a linear function of N, demonstrating that the average degree is essentially constant \u3008k\u3009 \u2248 3.0 since 1789. The total length versus N also displays a smooth behavior consistent with a perturbed lattice22. Indeed, if the segment length \u21131 is roughly constant and equal to  where \u03c1 = N/A is the density of nodes (A is the area considered here), we then obtain for the total length A fit of the type  is shown in Fig. 3(d) and the value of a measured gives an estimate of the area , in agreement with the actual value A = 33.6\u2005km2 (for the 1789 portion). This agreement demonstrates that all the networks at different times are not far from a perturbed lattice.NELtottotFig. 3Supplementary InformationNPdNdP2323Fig. 3(d\u2013f)ENkN2222\u21131\u03c1NAAFig. 3(d)aAkm2Figure 3Top panels: Number of (a) nodes, (b) total length (kms), and (c) rescaled average route distance versus time.Bottom panels: Number of (d) edges, (e) total length (kms), and (f) the rescaled average route distance versus the number of nodes N.

For a two dimensional spatial network, we expect this quantity to scale as  and thus increases with N. The ratio  is thus better suited to measure the efficiency of the network and we observe (Fig. 3(c,f)) that it decreases with time and N. This result simply demonstrate that if we neglect delays at junctions, it becomes easier to navigate in the network as it gets denser.dRRNFig. 3(c,f)NTypology of new linksWe can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4). In23, the distribution of this quantity displays two peaks which corresponds to two types of links belonging to two distinct processes: densification and exploration23. We first observe (see Figure 2 of SI) that in the first period, the majority of new links are of the E2 type and correspond to construction of new streets with new nodes. We see that the Haussmann transition period (1836\u20131888) is not particularly different from the other previous periods. In the modern period (after 1999), E0 becomes dominant and consistent with the idea of a mature street network where densification dominates the evolution of the urban tissue. Obviously, this is also an effect of limiting ourselves to the 1789 portion: in a wider area, many new roads were created and both densification and exploration coexist. We note here that the structure of the street network of central Paris remained remarkably stable from 1888 until now (and in this period also, densification was the main process in this area).EiiitiE0tt\u03b42323tt\u03b423232323SIE2E0We then plot the distribution of this quantity \u03b4 for the different transition periods and the result is shown in Fig. 4. These figures show that for all periods most new links belong to the densification process with a small peak of exploration in the period 1836\u20131888. In well-developed, mature systems, it is expected that densification is the dominant growth mechanism. Here also, we see that the Haussmann period is not significantly different from previous periods.\u03b4Fig. 4Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageFigure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageFigure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.Figure 4: Betweenness centrality impact distribution for the periods 1789 \u2192 1826, 1826 \u2192 1836, 1836 \u2192 1888, 1888 \u2192 1999, 1999 \u2192 2010.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.Full size imageFull size imageFull size imageEvolution of the spatial distribution of centralityThe betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26. In our case where we consider a limited portion of a spatial network, two important effects need to be taken into consideration. First, as we consider a portion, only paths within this portion are taken into account in the calculation of the BC and this usually does not reflect the reality of the actual origin-destination matrix. In particular, flows with the exterior of the portion and surrounding villages are not taken into account. As a result, the BC will be able to detect important routes and nodes in the internal structure of the network but will miss large-scale communication roads such as a north-south or a East-West road connecting the portion with the surroundings of Paris. In23, the scale of the network was large enough so that the BC could recover important central roads such as Roman streets. The BC in the present case has then to be used as a structural probe of the network, enabling us to track the important modifications. The second point concerns the spatial distribution of the BC which will be important in the following. For a lattice the most central nodes (see the discussion in22 for example) are close to the barycenter of the nodes: spatial centrality and betweenness centrality are then usually strongly correlated. In16 and17 it is shown that the most central points display interesting spatial structures which still need to be understood, but which represent an important signature of the networks' topology.gvvii26262323222216161717We first consider the time evolution of the node betweenness centrality (with similar results for the edge BC). In the SI (see figure 3 of SI), we show the distribution of the node BC at different times. Apart from the fact that the average BC varies, we see that the tail of the distribution remains constant in time, showing that the statistics of very central nodes is not modified. From this point of view, the evolution of the road network follows a smooth behavior, even in the Haussmann period.SISo far, most of the measures indicate that the evolution of the street network follows simple densification and exploration rules and is very similar to other areas studied23. At this point, it appears that Haussmann works didn't change radically the structure of the city. However, we can suspect that Haussmann's impact is very important on congestion and traffic and should therefore be seen on the spatial distribution of centrality. In the figure 5, we show the maps of Paris at different times and we indicate the most central nodes (such that their centrality gv(i) is larger than max gv/\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 10 see the SI, for a discussion on the effect of the value of \u03b1). We can clearly see here that the spatial distribution of the BC is not stable, displays large variations, and is not uniformly distributed over the Paris area (we represented here the node centrality, and similar results are obtained for the edge centrality, see the SI for plots for the edge centrality and more details). In particular, we see that between 1836 and 1888, the Haussmann works had a dramatical impact on the spatial structure of the centrality, especially near the heart of Paris. Central roads usually persist in time23,27, but in our case, the Haussmann reorganization was acting precisely at this level by redistributing the shortest paths which had certainly an impact on congestion inside the city. After Haussmann we observe a large stability of the network until nowadays.2323figure 5gvvigvv\u03b1\u03b1SI\u03b1SI23,272327Figure 5: Spatial distribution of the most central nodes (with centrality gv such that gv > max gv/10).We observe for the different periods important reorganizations of the spatial distribution of centrality, corresponding to different specific interventions.

For example, in the period 1789\u20131826 between the French Revolution and the Napoleonic empire, the maps shown in Fig. 5 display large variations with redistribution of central nodes which probably reflects the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads, improving congestion inside Paris. During the period 1826\u20131836 which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the the July Monarchy, the maps in Fig. 5 suggests an important reorganization on the east side of Paris. This seems to correspond very well to the creation during that period of a new channel in this area (the channel \u2018Saint Martin\u2019) which triggered many transformations in the eastern part of the network.Fig. 5Fig. 5In order to analyse the spatial redistribution effect more quantitatively, we compute various quantities inside a disk of radius r centered on the barycenter of all nodes (which stays approximately at the same location in time). We first study the number of nodes N(r) (Fig. 6), its variation \u03b4N(r) between t and t + 1, and the number of central nodes (such that gv(i) > max gv/10). We see that the largest variation of the number of nodes (see Fig. 6b) is indeed in the Haussmann period 1836\u20131888, especially for distance r > 1,500 meters. More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836). As a result, visually clear in Fig. 5, there is a large concentration of centrality in the center of Paris until 1836 at least. The natural consequence of this concentration is that the center of Paris was very probably very congested at that time. In this respect, what happens under the Haussmann supervision is natural as he acts on the spatial organization of centrality. We see indeed that in 1888, the most central nodes form a more reticulated structure excluding concentration of centrality. A structure which remained stable until now. Interestingly, we note that Haussmann's new roads and avenues represent approximately 6% of the total length only (compared to nowadays network), which is a small fraction, considered that it has a very important impact on the centrality spatial organization.rNrFig. 6\u03b4NrttgvvigvvFig. 6brFig. 6drrFig. 5Figure 6: Top panels: (a) number of nodes in a disk of radius r from the barycenter of Paris and (b) its variation versus r.As expected the largest variation occurred during the Haussmann period.

The effect of Haussmann modifications on the geometrical structure of blocks can be quantitatively measured by the distribution of the shape factor \u03d5 (see Methods) shown in Fig. 7. We see that before the Haussmann modifications, the distribution of \u03d5 is stable and is essentially centered around \u03d5 = 0.5 which corresponds to rectangles. From 1888, the distribution is however much flatter showing a larger diversity of shapes. In particular, we see that for small values of \u03d5 < 0.25 there is an important increase of P(\u03d5) demonstrating an abundance of elongated shapes (triangles and rectangles mostly) created by Haussmann's works. These effects can be confirmed by observing the angle distribution of roads shown on Fig. 8 where we represent on a polar plot r(\u03b8) = P(\u03b8) with P(\u03b8) the probability that a road segment makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal line. Before Haussmann's modifications, the distribution has two clear peaks corresponding to perpendicular streets and in 1888 we indeed observe a more uniform distribution with a large proportion of various angles such as diagonals.Fig. 1Fig. 2(b)\u03d5Fig. 7\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5P\u03d5Fig. 8r\u03b8P\u03b8P\u03b8\u03b8Figure 7: Probability distribution of the \u03d5 shape factor for the blocks at different years.Until 1836, this distribution is stable and we observe a dramatical change during the Haussmann period with a larger abundance of blocks with small value of \u03d5.

This case is particularly interesting as Paris experienced large modifications in the 19th century (the Haussmann period) allowing us to try to quantity the effect of central planning. Our results for central Paris reveal that most indicators follow a smooth evolution, dominated by a densification process, despite the important perturbation that happened during Haussmann. In our results, the important quantitative signature of central planning is the spatial reorganization of the most central nodes, in contrast with other regions where self-organization dominated and which didn't experience such a large-scale structure modification. This structural reorganization was obtained by the creation at a large scale of new roads and avenues (and the destruction of older roads) which do not follow the constraints of the existing geometry. These new roads do not follow the densification/exploration process but appear at various angles and intersect with many other existing roads.While the natural, self-organized evolution of roads seems in general to be local in space, the Haussmann modifications happen during a relatively short time and at a large spatial scale by connecting important nodes which are far away in the network. Following the Haussmann interventions, the natural processes take over on the modified substrate. It is unclear at this stage if Haussmann modifications were optimal and more importantly, if they were at a certain point inevitable and would have happened anyway (due to the high level of congestion for example). More work, with more data on a larger spatial scale are probably needed to study these important questions.DiscussionIn this paper, we have studied the evolution of the street network of the city of Paris.

The number of nodes at time t is then N(t) = |Vt| and the number of links is E(t) = |Et|. Using common definitions, we thus have Vt = Vt\u22121 \u222a \u0394Vt and Et = Et\u22121 \u222a \u0394Et, where \u0394Vt and \u0394Et are respectively the new street junctions and the new streets added in time ]t \u2212 1, t] to the network existing at time t \u2212 1.The networks for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888 are extracted from the following maps:1789: Map of the city of Paris with its new enclosure.

For spatial networks, it makes more sense to weight the links with their length: to each edge e we thus associate a weight de defined as the euclidean length of e. We can then compute the length  of a path P The shortest weighted path is then the one with the minimum total length. The average shortest weighted path is also called the average route distance dR. It indicates on average how many kilometers you have to walk from one point to the other in this spatial network. For a two dimensional network, it is expected22 that it scales as for a network of size N. In order to compare networks with different numbers of nodes N, it is then natural to compare the rescaled average route distance .Betweenness centrality, impactThe nature of the growth process can be quantitatively characterised by looking at the centrality of streets. Among the various centrality indices available for spatial networks we use here the betweenness centrality (BC)15,17,26, which is one of the measures of centrality commonly adopted to quantify the importance of a node or a link in a graph. Given the graph Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) at time t, the BC of a link e is defined as: where \u03c3ij is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j, while \u03c3ij(e) is the number of such shortest paths which contain the link e. The quantity g(e) essentially measures the number of times a link is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network. The BC of a node is defined in a similar way where \u03c3st(i) denotes here the number of shortest path from node s to t going through the node i.In order to evaluate the impact of a new link on the overall distribution of the betweenness centrality we use the betweenness centrality impact defined in23. In the graph at time t, we first compute the average betweenness centrality of all the links of Gt as: where g(e) is the betweenness centrality of the edge e in the graph Gt. Then, for each link e* \u2208 \u0394Et, i.e. for each newly added link in the time window ]t \u2212 1, t] we consider the new graph obtained by removing the link e* from Gt and we denote this graph as Gt\\{e*}. We compute again the average edge betweenness centrality, this time for the graph Gt\\{e*}. Finally, the impact \u03b4(e*) of edge e* on the betweenness centrality of the network at time t is defined as The BC impact is thus the relative variation of the graph average betweenness due to the removal of the link e*.Form factorThe shape or form factor \u03d5 of blocks is defined as the ratio of the area of the block and the area of the circumscribed circle of diameter D (see16,22) The more anisotropic the block and the smaller the factor \u03d5.MethodsTemporal network dataWe denote by Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) the obtained primal graph at time t, where Vt and Et are respectively the set of nodes and links at time t.

Among the various centrality indices available for spatial networks we use here the betweenness centrality (BC)15,17,26, which is one of the measures of centrality commonly adopted to quantify the importance of a node or a link in a graph. Given the graph Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) at time t, the BC of a link e is defined as: where \u03c3ij is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j, while \u03c3ij(e) is the number of such shortest paths which contain the link e. The quantity g(e) essentially measures the number of times a link is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network. The BC of a node is defined in a similar way where \u03c3st(i) denotes here the number of shortest path from node s to t going through the node i.In order to evaluate the impact of a new link on the overall distribution of the betweenness centrality we use the betweenness centrality impact defined in23. In the graph at time t, we first compute the average betweenness centrality of all the links of Gt as: where g(e) is the betweenness centrality of the edge e in the graph Gt. Then, for each link e* \u2208 \u0394Et, i.e. for each newly added link in the time window ]t \u2212 1, t] we consider the new graph obtained by removing the link e* from Gt and we denote this graph as Gt\\{e*}. We compute again the average edge betweenness centrality, this time for the graph Gt\\{e*}. Finally, the impact \u03b4(e*) of edge e* on the betweenness centrality of the network at time t is defined as The BC impact is thus the relative variation of the graph average betweenness due to the removal of the link e*.Form factorThe shape or form factor \u03d5 of blocks is defined as the ratio of the area of the block and the area of the circumscribed circle of diameter D (see16,22) The more anisotropic the block and the smaller the factor \u03d5.Temporal network dataWe denote by Gt \u2261 G(Vt, Et) the obtained primal graph at time t, where Vt and Et are respectively the set of nodes and links at time t. The number of nodes at time t is then N(t) = |Vt| and the number of links is E(t) = |Et|. Using common definitions, we thus have Vt = Vt\u22121 \u222a \u0394Vt and Et = Et\u22121 \u222a \u0394Et, where \u0394Vt and \u0394Et are respectively the new street junctions and the new streets added in time ]t \u2212 1, t] to the network existing at time t \u2212 1.GttGVttEtttVttEttttNtVttEtEttVttVtt\u22121\u222aVttEttEtt\u22121\u222aEttVttEtttttThe networks for 1789, 1826, 1836, 1888 are extracted from the following maps:1789: Map of the city of Paris with its new enclosure.

The network (and the block structure of figure 1) extracted from the Vasserot cadastre was initiated by Anne-Laure Bethe for the program Alpage28.figure 12828The networks of 1999 and 2010 are coming from the french Geographical National Institute (IGN) on the basis of modern surveys.Average route distanceFor a network, the shortest path between two nodes is defined as the path with the minimum number of links connecting the two nodes. For spatial networks, it makes more sense to weight the links with their length: to each edge e we thus associate a weight de defined as the euclidean length of e. We can then compute the length  of a path P The shortest weighted path is then the one with the minimum total length. The average shortest weighted path is also called the average route distance dR. It indicates on average how many kilometers you have to walk from one point to the other in this spatial network. For a two dimensional network, it is expected22 that it scales as for a network of size N. In order to compare networks with different numbers of nodes N, it is then natural to compare the rescaled average route distance .edeeePdRR2222NNBetweenness centrality, impactThe nature of the growth process can be quantitatively characterised by looking at the centrality of streets.

2014\n\n\n\nBy Belinda Lanks\n\n\n\nBy Belinda Lanks\nBelinda Lanks\nOctober 28, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph by Lionel Guericolas/Visual/Zuma WireThe Louis Vuitton Foundation contemporary art museumPhotograph by Lionel Guericolas/Visual/Zuma WireThe Louis Vuitton Foundation contemporary art museum\nThe much-anticipated Louis Vuitton Foundation (Fondation Louis-Vuitton), in Paris, is now open to the public. The massive museum for contemporary art, designed by Frank Gehry, is a spectacle: The gallery spaces are contained in cement blocks covered by massive, curved pieces of glass. Set in a public park in the Bois de Boulogne in the western part of the city, the structure seems to alight on the earth like a spaceship from the future.\nBernard Arnault, the 65-year-old chairman and chief executive of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC:FP), commissioned the museum, and both he and the 85-year-old Gehry hope this building will be an indisputably positive contribution to a complicated legacy.\nPhotograph courtesy Base DesignBase Design is responsible for the museum's understated branding\nIt\u2019s the first privately funded major cultural institution in France. Museums, opera houses, and the like are generally considered the domain of government bureaucracy in France. But LVMH managed to sidestep the usual objections by building the structure in a public park. In an agreement with the city for the plot, ownership of the museum will revert to Paris in 55 years. Even though the ostentatious design rankled a NIMBY group, the museum is, in essence, a gift to the city worth a reported $134 million.\nIt\u2019s part of an image overhaul. In France, Arnault is known as a ruthless businessman who descends upon and snatches up family-run luxury businesses at the first sign of weakness. His acumen has turned LVMH into the world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate and himself into the 20th richest man, with a net worth of $28.7 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The museum is one part of a PR campaign to show Arnault\u2019s softer side and his commitment to culture and heritage. Jean-Paul Claverie, who\u2019s in charge of LVMH\u2019s philanthropic endeavors, told the New York Times that the foundation is aimed at yielding \u201cnot economic returns but emotional ones.\u201dPhotograph by Bertrand Guay/AFP via Getty ImagesU.S. painter Ellsworth Kelly's Spectrum XVIIIIt\u2019s a milestone in digital fabrication. Gehry doesn\u2019t have a spotless reputation, either. Critical opinion is often split over his creations, and the cantankerous octogenarian isn\u2019t known for his diplomacy. Most recently, at a press conference in Spain, he dismissed \u201c98 percent\u201d of today\u2019s architecture as \u201cpure shit.\u201d Regardless of where you fall on the Gehry appreciation spectrum, you can at least give him credit for defining a distinctive aesthetic rooted in digital computing. The Louis Vuitton Foundation takes his signature approach to the next level. According to his office, more than 400 people contributed design plans, engineering rules, and construction constraints to a shared Web-hosted 3D digital model. The 3,600 glass panels and 19,000 concrete panels that form the fa\u00e7ade were simulated and then molded by industrial robots working off that common model.Photograph by Bertrand Guay/AFP via Getty ImagesView of the Louis Vuitton Foundation in the Bois de BoulogneIt\u2019s a mashup of recycled visual references. Gehry says the glass structure echoes 19th-century glass garden buildings. But he also revisits his obsession with maritime imagery. He calls the rectangular blocks containing the gallery spaces \u201cicebergs.\u201d His 2007 building for IAC/InterActiveCorp\u2019s (IACI) headquarters also resembles an iceberg on Manhattan\u2019s far West Side. The 12 panels of glass that cover the icebergs are \u201csails\u201d\u2014a trope Gehry also used in his 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you look at the front of Disney Hall,\u201d the designer said, \u201cit\u2019s wing-on-wing, it\u2019s the two sails, and you\u2019re at the helm.\u201d\n\n\nVideo: An Inside Look at the Louis Vuitton Foundation\n\n\nStory: Architect Craig Dykers on His Plans for SFMOMA and Remaking Times Square\n\n\nStory: The 350,000 Percent Rise of Christopher Wool's Masterpiece Painting\n\n\nThe much-anticipated Louis Vuitton Foundation (Fondation Louis-Vuitton), in Paris, is now open to the public.

Combien de musulmans en France\u00a0?\n\nA l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2014, un sondage de l'institut Ipsos Mori r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans plusieurs pays montrait qu'\u00e0 l'instar des Britanniques, les Fran\u00e7ais surestimaient fortement le nombre de personnes de confession musulmane en France\u00a0: interrog\u00e9s sur une estimation sur 100 personnes, ils r\u00e9pondaient en moyenne 23\u00a0%, alors que la bonne r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait 8\u00a0%.\n\u00a02,1 millions ? En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le chiffre exact est plus flou. La loi fran\u00e7aise interdit de recenser les populations par religion, ce qui emp\u00eache d'avoir un chiffrage pr\u00e9cis. N\u00e9anmoins, nous disposons de quelques estimations. Ainsi, l'enqu\u00eate \u00ab\u00a0trajectoire et origines\u00a0\u00bb men\u00e9e par l'Insee et l'INED, sur la base de sondages, estimait les fid\u00e8les musulmans \u00e0 2,1 millions en 2008, contre 11,5\u00a0millions de catholiques, parmi la population de 18 \u00e0 50\u00a0ans. Un \u00e9chantillon qui, pour les deux religions, ne compte donc ni les seniors, ni les mineurs.\n3,9 millions ? Le chercheur Patrick Simon, de l'INED, \u00e9voque, en extrapolant les estimations sur les 18-50 ans \u00e0 l'ensemble de la population, un chiffreun peu plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 : entre 3,9 et 4,1 millions de personnes en France seraient \u00ab musulmans\u00a0\u00bb, avec les m\u00eames r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 cette appellation.\n\u00a04 \u00e0 5\u00a0millions\u00a0? C'est le chiffre qu'on entend le plus souvent. Il provient du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur et n'est qu'une approximation assez floue\u00a0: il s'agit d'une extrapolation tir\u00e9e de l'origine g\u00e9ographique des populations. On pourrait donc dire qu'il compte les personnes de \u00ab\u00a0culture musulmane\u00a0\u00bb, qu'elles soient ou non pratiquantes dans leur quotidien.\n\n \n\nCette extrapolation est classique. Ainsi, nombre de sondages n'h\u00e9sitent pas \u00e0 utiliser l'expression \u00ab\u00a0d'origine musulmane\u00a0\u00bb, ce qui entretient la confusion : on peut \u00eatre d'origine maghr\u00e9bine sans \u00eatre de confession musulmane.\nPour l'anecdote, un recensement effectu\u00e9 en 1906 avait estim\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 10\u00a0% la part des habitants de confession musulmane, soit environ 3,9\u00a0millions sur une population totale d'environ 39\u00a0millions de personnes. Ce chiffre s'explique par l'inclusion dans le recensement de l'Alg\u00e9rie, qui \u00e9tait alors une colonie fran\u00e7aise.\nLa dynamique est en revanche notable\u00a0: le nombre de fid\u00e8les musulmans tend \u00e0 augmenter depuis trente ans dans le pays, quand le nombre de catholiques conna\u00eet le mouvement inverse.\n\n2. Quelle pratique de l'islam\u00a0?\n\nIl faut \u00e9galement grandement relativiser la diff\u00e9rence entre se d\u00e9clarer croyant et pratiquer une religion. A l'instar des personnes se pr\u00e9sentant comme catholiques, dont une partie seulement fr\u00e9quente l'\u00e9glise chaque semaine, les musulmans sont peu nombreux \u00e0 prier chaque jour ou aller chaque semaine \u00e0 la mosqu\u00e9e.\nSelon une enqu\u00eate de l'IFOP pour le journal La Croix en 2011, bas\u00e9e sur un cumul d'enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, 75\u00a0% des personnes issues de familles \u00ab\u00a0d'origine musulmane\u00a0\u00bb (sic) se disaient croyantes. C'est davantage que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente \u00e9tude en 2007 (71\u00a0%) mais moins que celle d'avant en 2001 (78\u00a0%). Cette variation, caus\u00e9e par l'aspect d\u00e9claratif de l'enqu\u00eate, illustre la difficult\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le nombre de croyants.\nLa population se revendiquant musulmane est plus forte chez les immigr\u00e9s et descendants de deux parents immigr\u00e9s, qui sont \u00e9galement les deux cat\u00e9gories o\u00f9 l'on retrouve la proportion la plus faible de personnes se disant \u00ab sans religion\u00a0\u00bb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDans le d\u00e9tail, 41 % des personnes\u00a0\u00ab d'origine musulmane\u00a0\u00bb se disaient \u00ab\u00a0croyantes et pratiquantes\u00a0\u00bb (contre 16\u00a0% chez les catholiques), et 34\u00a0% \u00ab\u00a0croyantes mais non pratiquantes\u00a0\u00bb (57\u00a0% des catholiques), 25\u00a0% se disant \u00ab\u00a0sans religion ou seulement d'origine musulmane\u00a0\u00bb (27 % des catholiques). Seuls 25 % des interrog\u00e9s disaient aller \u00ab\u00a0g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la mosqu\u00e9e le vendredi\u00a0\u00bb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL'enqu\u00eate montrait une hausse de la pratique du je\u00fbne durant le mois de ramadan, observ\u00e9 par 71\u00a0% des interrog\u00e9s, contre 60\u00a0% lors d'une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente en 1989. En revanche, seuls 6 % des interrog\u00e9s disaient avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 effectu\u00e9 le p\u00e8lerinage \u00e0 La Mecque, qui est l'un des piliers de la religion musulmane.\nAutre indication int\u00e9ressante de l'\u00e9tude IFOP : un tiers des personnes \u00ab d'origine musulmane\u00a0\u00bb disaient consommer de l'alcool, pourtant interdit par l'islam. A contrario, pr\u00e8s des trois quarts des r\u00e9pondants disaient acheter \u00ab\u00a0syst\u00e9matiquement\u00a0\u00bb ou \u00ab\u00a0de temps en temps\u00a0\u00bb de la viande halal, abattue dans le respect des rites islamiques.\nDans son \u00e9tude publi\u00e9e en en 2010, l'INED avait observ\u00e9 \u00ab\u00a0un clivage entre les groupes en lien avec des r\u00e9gions o\u00f9 l'islam est dominant et les autres\u00a0\u00bb.\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0Non seulement les proportions de 'sans religion' sont plus faibles chez les immigr\u00e9s qui viennent des r\u00e9gions islamis\u00e9es, mais leurs descendants d\u00e9clarent plus souvent une\u00a0r\u00e9f\u00e9rence religieuse que les autres. La transmission semble plus fr\u00e9quente dans les familles \u00e0 dominante musulmane que dans celles inscrites dans le catholicisme, le protestantisme ou le bouddhisme.\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\u00a03. Combien de mosqu\u00e9es ?\n\nAutre flou, celui qui r\u00e8gne sur le nombre de mosqu\u00e9es en France. Selon le minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur, on recensait, en 2012, 2\u00a0449\u00a0lieux de culte musulman dans le pays, dont 318 en outre-mer. Le minist\u00e8re donnait une estimation de la progression de ce nombre de lieux, qui a doubl\u00e9 depuis 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\u00e9anmoins, un lieu de culte n'est pas une mosqu\u00e9e. Pour l'essentiel, les musulmans fran\u00e7ais prient dans des salles discr\u00e8tes, m\u00eame si on constate depuis la fin des ann\u00e9es 2000 une vague de constructions de mosqu\u00e9es plus visibles. On comptait en 2009 seulement 64\u00a0mosqu\u00e9es dot\u00e9es de minarets pour pr\u00e8s de 2 500 lieux de pri\u00e8re, soit 2,5\u00a0% environ, bien loin du symbole que repr\u00e9sentent ces tours pour certains.\n1/1\u00a0200 Si on rapporte le nombre de pratiquants de l'islam au nombre de lieux de culte, on arrive \u00e0 un rapport significatif\u00a0: si on compte 3\u00a0millions de pratiquants musulmans, on parvient \u00e0 un lieu pour 1 200 fid\u00e8les. Si on compare avec le catholicisme, on recense environ 40\u00a0000\u00a0\u00e9glises en France, pour 11\u00a0millions de catholiques pratiquants, soit une \u00e9glise pour 275 fid\u00e8les.\n\n4. Combien de musulmans \u00ab\u00a0radicaux\u00a0\u00bb ?\n\nParmi ces millions de musulmans, combien sont \u00ab\u00a0radicaux\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0? Il faut d\u00e9j\u00e0 s'entendre sur le sens du mot \u00ab\u00a0radical\u00a0\u00bb. Il existe en effet plusieurs pratiques de l'islam, et \u00a0plusieurs \u00e9coles.\nOn estime en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que les plus rigides dans la pratique sont les salafistes sunnites, adeptes d'un mouvement qui pr\u00eache un retour \u00e0 l'islam \u00ab\u00a0des origines\u00a0\u00bb. Financ\u00e9 par les monarchies du Golfe, le pros\u00e9lytisme salafiste a permis \u00e0 ce mouvement de conqu\u00e9rir des fid\u00e8les depuis une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es en Europe, voire d'imposer certaines pratiques, comme le voile int\u00e9gral.\n15\u00a0000 En 2012, le sociologue Samir Amghar, sp\u00e9cialiste de la question, expliquait notamment dans La D\u00e9p\u00eache que\u00a0\u00ab selon les renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, les salafistes sont entre 12 000 et 15 000 en France\u00a0\u00bb. Le chiffre correspondait donc \u00e0 un salafiste pour environ 200\u00a0pratiquants musulmans en France.\n\n \n\nEt l\u00e0 encore, \u00eatre salafiste ou fondamentaliste ne veut pas dire croire aux vertus du djihad ni cautionner la violence comme moyen d'action. Le salafisme poss\u00e8de en son sein une composante djihadiste, \u00ab\u00a0mais les salafistes djihadistes sont ultraminoritaires\" pr\u00e9cisait M. Amghar.\nOn peut comparer ces chiffres \u00e0 ceux du nombre de personnes \u00ab\u00a0impliqu\u00e9es\u00a0\u00bb dans des fili\u00e8res djihadistes, c'est-\u00e0-dire partis combattre en Syrie, d\u00e9sirant y partir ou aidant \u00e0 organiser des d\u00e9parts. Selon Bernard Cazeneuve, ils seraient au total environ 2\u00a0000 soit 0,075\u00a0% des personnes pratiquant l'islam.\n\u00a04\u00a0000 Nombre de fantasmes existent \u00e9galement concernant les conversions \u00e0 l'islam. L\u00e0 encore, il n'existe que peu de chiffres fiables sur le sujet. Bernard Godard, consultant pour le minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur et des cultes, estimait en 2012\u00a0qu'il y avait environ 4\u00a0000\u00a0conversions en France chaque ann\u00e9e, et autour de 100\u00a0000\u00a0personnes \u00e9lev\u00e9es dans des familles de culture chr\u00e9tiennes qui se seraient converties.\n\n5. Halal, voile : une jeunesse plus revendicative\n\nLes sp\u00e9cialistes de l'islam soulignent d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui peuvent expliquer les peurs et les fantasmes. Les pratiques de l'islam acqui\u00e8rent, sp\u00e9cialement aupr\u00e8s des jeunes g\u00e9n\u00e9rations de musulmans, une visibilit\u00e9 nouvelle, du fait de pratiques, notamment issues du salafisme, comme le port du voile int\u00e9gral dans la rue, ou des revendications autour du voile \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.\nL'\u00e9mergence d'une fili\u00e8re halal est \u00e9galement une composante de cette visibilit\u00e9 croissante. Selon un cabinet sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9, Solis, ce march\u00e9 \u00e9tait, en 2013, de 5,5\u00a0milliards d'euros, en forte croissance depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. \u00a0Il \u00e9tait surtout concentr\u00e9 sur la viande, qui repr\u00e9sente 88\u00a0% du chiffre d'affaires du secteur.\nEn 2013, Hugues Lagrange, sociologue au CNRS, publiait une \u00e9tude qui montrait que cette affirmation plus forte de la pratique et de l'identit\u00e9 musulmane \u00e9tait surtout le fait des jeunes. \u00ab\u00a0La r\u00e9surgence des pratiques cultuelles et la religiosit\u00e9 augmentent chez les immigr\u00e9s venus en France avant l'\u00e2ge de 16\u00a0ans et chez les Fran\u00e7ais descendants d'immigr\u00e9s, mais pas chez les immigr\u00e9s arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge adulte\u00a0\u00bb, expliquait-il. Pour le sociologue, c'est le r\u00e9sultat d'un \u00ab\u00a0sentiment de rel\u00e9gation sociale\u00a0\u00bb qui favorise l'\u00e9mergence d'une culture de l'islam rigoriste parfois oppos\u00e9 aux valeurs de la R\u00e9publique.\nLire :\u00a0En France, des jeunes de plus en plus fid\u00e8les \u00e0 l'islam\nSelon son \u00e9tude, 90\u00a0% des 18-25\u00a0ans respectaient les prescriptions alimentaires musulmanes et le ramadan, soit plus que leurs a\u00een\u00e9s. Une conclusion qui avait pos\u00e9 question, et qui rejoignait d'autres \u00e9tudes, tendant \u00e0 montrer que les musulmans \u00ab qui vivent dans les \"quartiers immigr\u00e9s\" sont sensiblement plus religieux que ceux qui sont dispers\u00e9s dans des \"quartiers m\u00e9lang\u00e9s\" \u00bb ou ceux issus de couples mixtes. Une cons\u00e9quence, pour lui, de l'\u00e9chec de l'int\u00e9gration : \u00ab Pour les jeunes ayant r\u00e9ussi leurs \u00e9tudes ou vivant loin des cit\u00e9s, l'islam est un islam d'Europe, plus moderniste, marqu\u00e9 par une foi plus personnalis\u00e9e.\u00a0\u00bb\nLire aussi nos d\u00e9bats : Un islam \u00e0 r\u00e9former ?\nJeudi 18 juin marque le d\u00e9but, en France, du je\u00fbne du ramadan, observ\u00e9 par les musulmans du monde entier.

Photograph: Gemma Ware/guardian.co.uk\n\n\nGemma Ware\n\n\nWednesday 3 March 2010 02.00\u00a0EST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its upbeat swing of guitars, violin and the occasional clarinet or saxophone, jazz manouche is the music of Paris's Gypsy periphery that made it to the big time. This year marks the centenary of the birth of legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt and Paris has been paying homage to the inventor of Gypsy jazz.\nIn the northern 18th arrondissement, near the banlieue of Saint-Ouen where Django's family moved their caravan from Belgium when he was a boy, a square was renamed Place Django Reinhardt in a ceremony to mark his birthday on 23 January. Other centenary celebrations include a performance of the Django 100 group of modern stars of jazz manouche at the Th\u00e9atre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es on 14 March and a centenary edition of the Django Reinhardt Festival in June at Samois-sur-Seine, south of Paris.\u00a0The clubs where Django made his name with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette of the Hot Club of France in the 1930s and 40s have for the most part either shut or turned into more modern jazz venues. Today, in a France where Gypsies remain outcasts, the best manouche musicians \u2013 young and old \u2013 can still be found on the city's outskirts. But Django's Minor Swing continues to echo across Paris's caf\u00e9-jazz scene every night. Here are a few cafes to watch jazz by.\n\nLa Chope des Puces (Espace Django Reinhardt)\n\nParis's temple to Django Reinhardt, this bar in Saint-Ouen is near the spot where Django lived - and where he was badly burnt in a caravan-fire in 1928, losing the use of two fingers on his left hand which led to his distinctive jazz phrasing. Next to the March\u00e9 aux Puces, the flea and antique market that is a Sunday-afternoon must for visitors, the bar plays host every weekend to the guitarist Ninine Garcia, head of Paris's premier family of jazz manouchists. Fans share tables or stand at the bar sipping espressos and examining the cases of guitars played by former jazz greats on the walls. Behind the tiny bar is a restaurant/concert venue filled with fairground memorabilia that serves a standard French carte on weekends. Backstage is a lutherie (maker of string instruments) and jazz school teaching manouche chord-progressions to Django-wannabees. This great clip  from La Chope des Puces 1965 should get you going.\u00a0\u2022 122 rue Rosiers, 93400 Saint Ouen; +33 (0) 1 40 11 02 49. lachopedespuces.com. Jazz manouche every Saturday and Sunday 2pm - 7pm. Metro: Porte de Clignancourt. \nBouquet du Nord\n\n\n\nPhotograph: Gemma Ware/guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\u00a0Inhabiting the corner of a busy intersection near Gare du Nord, every Friday this brasserie plays home to some of the best and most authentic practitioners of jazz manouche. Violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli lived opposite and used to come in for a drink; the older men who play here, some of them tziganes (Gypsies), knew and played with him. Well-lit with friendly staff busily working the large counter, the musicians work their magic next to the cake cabinet. There is a large terrace where you can sit watching the traffic in true Parisian style. Come early to listen while you dine, or later to get these ageing jazz maestros all to yourself.\u00a0\u2022 85, rue de Maubeuge, 70010; +33 (0) 1 48 78 29 97. Concerts every Friday from 7pm \u2013 midnight. Jam possible for experienced players. Metro: Gare du Nord.\u00a0\nLa Locandiera\n\n\n\n\u00a0Rue Oberkampf is a buzzing focal point for nightlife in eastern Paris. At the northern end is this Italianate restaurant and bar, with red curtains half-hiding the street, bookshelves along one wall and rows of slatted wooden tables. In the early evening, the jazz acts as background to the dining, but grows into a boeuf (jam session) later as other musicians join in with the regulars. An underground cave hosts comedy and theatre other nights of the week. Another restaurant/bar further down the road, Styx, also does jazz manouche on Monday nights.\u00a0\u2022 145 rue Oberkampf, 75011 Paris. +33 (0) 1 56 98 12 18, la-locandiera.abcsalles.com. Jazz manouche every Tuesday from 9pm and every other Saturday. Jam possible. Open until 2am. Metro: M\u00e9nilmontant \nLa Chope de Ch\u00e2teau Rouge\n\n\n\nPhotograph: Gemma Ware/guardian.co.uk\n\n\nSitting on the fautline between the cobble-stoned streets of Montmarte and the North African community of Paris's lively north-east corner, this bar/brasserie is a local gem. Large windows open on to a busy street and inside a guitar has been roughly painted on to a mirror that lines one wall. Listening to jazz here is an intimate and very French experience. Musicians sit in the centre of the room, joking with the locals, manouche-lovers and a handful of tourists. Experienced players can bring their instruments and have a boeuf. The bar staff are friendly and will try hard to squeeze you on to a table, or find a spot at the bar.\u00a0\u2022 40 rue de Clignancourt, 75018; +33 (0) 1 46 06 20 10. Jazz manouche every Tuesday 9pm \u2013 1pm. Jam possible. Metro: Ch\u00e2teau Rouge.\u00a0\nL'atelier Charonne\nOpened in 2008 by a lover of jazz manouche, this bar and restaurant near the Bastille is a welcome addition to those looking for a more sophisticated dinner-jazz experience. Red strip lights give it an upmarket feel, and it is populated by couples and groups of French jazz enthusiasts. The bar serves a set menu for \u20ac35 (main and starter or dessert) to tables set in front of the small stage, but you can sit and listen for free nearer the bar. There is jazz every night \u2013 (check the website for a detailed programme that includes Django's grandson David Reinhardt) \u2013 and it's a good idea to book ahead for dinner table.\u00a0\u2022 21 rue Charonne, 75011; +33 (0) 1 40 21 83 35, ateliercharonne.com.

Metro: Bastille or Ledru-Rollin. \u00a0\nClarion de Chasseurs\n\n\n\nPhotograph: Gemma Ware/guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\u00a0This bar and restaurant is touristy, but plays jazz every night from some of Paris's best musicians in the heart of Montmartre. It's a good place to stop once you're done watching the caricaturists plying their trade in the Place de Tertre. The jazz numbers are traditional Django favourites and the musicians lap-up the applause as their intricate guitar solos waft out across the square.

Photograph: Gemma Ware/guardian.co.uk\n\n\nGemma Ware\n\n\nWednesday 3 March 2010 02.00\u00a0EST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its upbeat swing of guitars, violin and the occasional clarinet or saxophone, jazz manouche is the music of Paris's Gypsy periphery that made it to the big time. This year marks the centenary of the birth of legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt and Paris has been paying homage to the inventor of Gypsy jazz.\nIn the northern 18th arrondissement, near the banlieue of Saint-Ouen where Django's family moved their caravan from Belgium when he was a boy, a square was renamed Place Django Reinhardt in a ceremony to mark his birthday on 23 January. Other centenary celebrations include a performance of the Django 100 group of modern stars of jazz manouche at the Th\u00e9atre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es on 14 March and a centenary edition of the Django Reinhardt Festival in June at Samois-sur-Seine, south of Paris.\u00a0The clubs where Django made his name with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette of the Hot Club of France in the 1930s and 40s have for the most part either shut or turned into more modern jazz venues. Today, in a France where Gypsies remain outcasts, the best manouche musicians \u2013 young and old \u2013 can still be found on the city's outskirts. But Django's Minor Swing continues to echo across Paris's caf\u00e9-jazz scene every night. Here are a few cafes to watch jazz by.\n\nLa Chope des Puces (Espace Django Reinhardt)\n\nParis's temple to Django Reinhardt, this bar in Saint-Ouen is near the spot where Django lived - and where he was badly burnt in a caravan-fire in 1928, losing the use of two fingers on his left hand which led to his distinctive jazz phrasing. Next to the March\u00e9 aux Puces, the flea and antique market that is a Sunday-afternoon must for visitors, the bar plays host every weekend to the guitarist Ninine Garcia, head of Paris's premier family of jazz manouchists. Fans share tables or stand at the bar sipping espressos and examining the cases of guitars played by former jazz greats on the walls. Behind the tiny bar is a restaurant/concert venue filled with fairground memorabilia that serves a standard French carte on weekends. Backstage is a lutherie (maker of string instruments) and jazz school teaching manouche chord-progressions to Django-wannabees. This great clip  from La Chope des Puces 1965 should get you going.\u00a0\u2022 122 rue Rosiers, 93400 Saint Ouen; +33 (0) 1 40 11 02 49. lachopedespuces.com.

Violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli lived opposite and used to come in for a drink; the older men who play here, some of them tziganes (Gypsies), knew and played with him. Well-lit with friendly staff busily working the large counter, the musicians work their magic next to the cake cabinet. There is a large terrace where you can sit watching the traffic in true Parisian style.

At the northern end is this Italianate restaurant and bar, with red curtains half-hiding the street, bookshelves along one wall and rows of slatted wooden tables. In the early evening, the jazz acts as background to the dining, but grows into a boeuf (jam session) later as other musicians join in with the regulars.

Large windows open on to a busy street and inside a guitar has been roughly painted on to a mirror that lines one wall. Listening to jazz here is an intimate and very French experience. Musicians sit in the centre of the room, joking with the locals, manouche-lovers and a handful of tourists. Experienced players can bring their instruments and have a boeuf.

Jazz manouche every Tuesday from 9pm and every other Saturday. Jam possible. Open until 2am.

Large windows open on to a busy street and inside a guitar has been roughly painted on to a mirror that lines one wall. Listening to jazz here is an intimate and very French experience. Musicians sit in the centre of the room, joking with the locals, manouche-lovers and a handful of tourists. Experienced players can bring their instruments and have a boeuf. The bar staff are friendly and will try hard to squeeze you on to a table, or find a spot at the bar.\u00a0\u2022 40 rue de Clignancourt, 75018; +33 (0) 1 46 06 20 10. Jazz manouche every Tuesday 9pm \u2013 1pm. Jam possible. Metro: Ch\u00e2teau Rouge.\u00a0\u2022L'atelier CharonneOpened in 2008 by a lover of jazz manouche, this bar and restaurant near the Bastille is a welcome addition to those looking for a more sophisticated dinner-jazz experience. Red strip lights give it an upmarket feel, and it is populated by couples and groups of French jazz enthusiasts. The bar serves a set menu for \u20ac35 (main and starter or dessert) to tables set in front of the small stage, but you can sit and listen for free nearer the bar. There is jazz every night \u2013 (check the website for a detailed programme that includes Django's grandson David Reinhardt) \u2013 and it's a good idea to book ahead for dinner table.\u00a0\u2022 21 rue Charonne, 75011; +33 (0) 1 40 21 83 35, ateliercharonne.com. Concerts every day from 9pm \u2013 midnight.

It's a good place to stop once you're done watching the caricaturists plying their trade in the Place de Tertre. The jazz numbers are traditional Django favourites and the musicians lap-up the applause as their intricate guitar solos waft out across the square. A tip: it's cheaper to have a drink inside than on the terrace.\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 3 Place de Tertre, 75018; + 33 (0) 1 42 62 40 08. Jazz manouche every night from 9pm.

Over the last three decades, France has grown to become the largest market in the world (behind only the United States) for the production and consumption of this genre. But French hip-hop is not a copy of its American precursor. On the contrary, it is a rich scene of French artists who rap in their national language (and local argot) and narrate their own unique socio-political realities.\nEnnio Leanza/Keystone, via European Pressphoto Agency From left, Sa\u00efd, Akhenaton and Shurik'n, all affiliated with the French hip-hop group IAM.  \nUnbeknownst to Americans, the French were among the first to embrace hip-hop.

Later, the French minister of culture Jack Lang, whose mission was to promote and cultivate \"French\" culture, proclaimed that \"intellectually, morally and artistically,\" hip-hop was a movement: \"Even if in the beginning it drew inspiration from America, I believe it has found its originality here in France.\" In a decade, hip-hop went from being a fun, foreign, American import to being recognized as a source of French cultural pride.\nThe story of hip-hop in France makes clear that culture \u2014 and sometimes, in particular, presumed \"national cultures\" \u2014 are malleable and fluid. The borders that are constructed around a set of cultural practices and mark them as truly \"French\" or \"American\" only reflect the concerns of a given moment.
