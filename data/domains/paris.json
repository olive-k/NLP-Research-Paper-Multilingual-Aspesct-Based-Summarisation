Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the \u00cele-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2017 population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France. The Paris Region had a GDP of \u20ac709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Z\u00fcrich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva. Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.The city is a major railway, highway and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in Europe) and Paris\u2013Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris M\u00e9tro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily; it is the second busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway station in the world, but the first located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015. Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2019, with 9.6 million visitors.  However, the number of visitors plunged by 72 percent to 2.7 million visitors in 2020, due to the COVID virus and the drop in the number of foreign visitors.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site, and popular landmarks there included the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur on the hill of Montmartre.\nParis received 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. It was ranked as the second  most visited travel destination in the world in 2019, after Bangkok and just ahead of London. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Fran\u00e7ais are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.\n\n\n", "1": "\n\nThe name 'Paris' is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period. The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym is debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the root pario- ('cauldron'). Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-. Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr 'spear', derived from an earlier *kwar-s\u0101. In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.\nParis is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (La Ville Lumi\u00e8re), both because of its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment and more literally because Paris was one of the first large European cities to use gas street lighting on a grand scale on its boulevards and monuments. Gas lights were installed on the Place du Carrousel, Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards were lit. By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps. Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.Inhabitants are known in English as \"Parisians\" and in French as Parisiens ([pa\u0281izj\u025b\u0303] (listen)). They are also pejoratively called Parigots ([pa\u0281i\u0261o] (listen)).\n\n\n", "2": "\n\n\n", "3": "\n\nThe Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC. One of the area's major north\u2013south trade routes crossed the Seine on the \u00eele de la Cit\u00e9; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became an important trading centre. The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for that purpose.\n\nThe Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris' Left Bank. The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, \"Lutetia of the Parisii\", modern French Lut\u00e8ce). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as Parisius, a Latin name that would later become Paris in French. Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508.  As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris' strategic importance\u2014with its bridges preventing ships from passing\u2014was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885\u201386), for which the then Count of Paris (comte de Paris), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia. From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (duc des Francs), as king of a unified Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.\n\n\n", "4": "\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France. The Palais de la Cit\u00e9, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.\nAfter the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in around the 10th century, Paris' cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 and Place de la Gr\u00e8ve (Place de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.\nIn the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.\nIn the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed. The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris' streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal, which he bequeathed to Louis XIII. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today. Other marks of his reign were the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vend\u00f4me, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.\n\n\n", "5": "\n\nParis grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. A new boulevard, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, extended the city west to \u00c9toile, while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclop\u00e9die in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.\n\nIn the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage for the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the H\u00f4tel de Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly.Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined (executed) in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France. The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished. A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (coup d'\u00e9tat du 18 brumaire), when Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.\n\nThe population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000. Napoleon Bonaparte replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect reporting only to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.During the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names, but the July Revolution of 1830 in Paris, (commemorated by the July Column on Place de la Bastille), brought a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I, to power. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.\nLouis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. After months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. On 28 March, a revolutionary government called the Paris Commune seized power in Paris. The Commune held power for two months, until it was harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.\n\nLate in the 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower; and the 1900 Universal Exposition, which gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris M\u00e9tro line. Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (\u00c9mile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).\n\n\n", "6": "\n\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to 2,715,000. At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art, and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.During the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as Les Ann\u00e9es Folles, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Ana\u00efs Nin, Sidney Bechet Allen Ginsberg and the surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed.In the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor.\n\nOn 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an \"open city\". On 16\u201317 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv (V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back. On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the H\u00f4tel de Ville.In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses. In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793. The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 metres (689 feet) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high. The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs. A suburban railway network, the RER (R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional), was built to complement the M\u00e9tro, and the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.Most of the postwar's Presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing began the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (1986); President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the Op\u00e9ra Bastille (1985\u20131989), the new site of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (1996), the Arche de la D\u00e9fense (1985\u20131989), and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983\u20131989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly.In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delano\u00eb became the first Socialist Mayor of Paris. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the V\u00e9lib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delano\u00eb also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.In 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016. In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 kilometres (127 miles) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of \u20ac35 billion. The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.\n\n\n", "7": "\n\nBetween July and October 1995, a series of bombings carried out by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria caused 8 deaths and more than 200 injuries.On 7 January 2015, two French Muslim extremists attacked the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo and killed thirteen people, in an attack claimed by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and on 9 January, a third terrorist, who claimed he was part of ISIL, killed four hostages during an attack at a Jewish grocery store at Porte de Vincennes. On 11 January an estimated 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech. On 13 November of the same year, a series of coordinated bomb and gunfire terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis, claimed by ISIL, killed 130 people and injured more than 350.On 3 February 2017, a two-backpack-carrying, machete-wielding attacker shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" attacked soldiers guarding the Louvre museum after they stopped him because of his bags; the assailant was shot, and no explosives were found. On 18 March of the same year, in a Vitry-sur-Seine bar, a man held patrons hostage, then fled to later hold a gun to the head of an Orly Airport French soldier, shouting \"I am here to die in the name of Allah\", and was shot dead by the soldier's comrades. On 20 April, a man fatally shot a French police officer on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and was later shot dead himself. On 19 June, a man rammed his weapons-and-explosives-laden vehicle into a police van on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, but the car only burst into flames.\n\n\n", "8": "\n\n\n", "9": "\n\nParis is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the \u00cele Saint-Louis and the larger \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river. Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi). The metropolitan area of the city is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).Measured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is 450 kilometres (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.\n\n\n", "10": "\n\nParis has a typical Western European oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet. Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 \u00b0C (59 and 77 \u00b0F), and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for weeks, reached 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night. Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons. In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dip below \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F). Snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground.

The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974. The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793. The mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014 and re-elected 28 June 2020.The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 34 members for the most populated (the 15th). The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system.  Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round \u2013 or at least a plurality in the second round \u2013 automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement.  The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.  This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they don't win an absolute majority of the vote.\n\nOnce elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government, primarily because it meets only once a month. The council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre-right, plus a few members from smaller parties.Each of Paris' 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor. The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.The budget of the city for 2018 is 9.5 billion Euros, with an expected deficit of 5.5 billion Euros. 7.9 billion Euros are designated for city administration, and 1.7 billion Euros for investment. The number of city employees increased from 40,000 in 2001 to 55,000 in 2018. The largest part of the investment budget is earmarked for public housing (262 million Euros) and for real estate (142 million Euros).\n\n\n", "13": "\n\nThe M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016. It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 square kilometres (314 square miles) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, a Republican and the mayor of the town of Rueil-Malmaison, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.\n\n\n", "14": "\nThe Region of \u00cele de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.\n\n\n", "15": "\n\nAs the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in the 8th arrondissement, while the Prime Minister's seat is at the H\u00f4tel Matignon in the 7th arrondissement. Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Matignon.The two houses of the French Parliament are located on the Left Bank. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement, while the more important lower house, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, meets in the Palais Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the \"Petit Luxembourg\", a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.\n\nFrance's highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, while the Conseil d'\u00c9tat, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.\nFollowing the motto \"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris\"; the only sister city of Paris is Rome, although Paris has partnership agreements with many other cities around the world.\n\n\n", "16": "\n\nThe security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis L\u00e9pine on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9.There are 30,200 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events.\nThe police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. The traditional kepis of the gendarmes were replaced in 2002 with caps, and the force modernised, though they still wear kepis for ceremonial occasions.Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\n\n\n", "17": "\n\n\n", "18": "\n\nMost French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the \u00cele Saint-Louis and the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. A third one is the 1827 artificially created \u00cele aux Cygnes.\n\nModern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey \"Paris stone\". They also built the major parks around the city centre. The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.\n\nParis' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974\u20132010 building height limitation of 37 metres (121 ft) was raised to 50 m (160 ft) in central areas and 180 metres (590 ft) in some of Paris' peripheral quarters, yet for some of the city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect. The 210 metres (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building until 1973, but this record has been held by the La D\u00e9fense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.\nParisian examples of European architecture date back more than a millennium, including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (1014\u20131163), the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163\u20131345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239\u20131248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627\u20131641) and Les Invalides (1670\u20131708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808\u20131842), the Palais Garnier serving as an opera house (1875), the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (1875\u20131919), as well as the exuberant Belle \u00c9poque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking examples of 20th-century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie by various architects (1986), the Arab World Institute by Jean Nouvel (1987), the Louvre Pyramid by I. M. Pei (1989) and the Op\u00e9ra Bastille by Carlos Ott (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly \u2013 Jacques Chirac by Jean Nouvel (2006), the contemporary art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014) and the new Tribunal de grande instance de Paris by Renzo Piano (2018).\n\n\n", "19": "\nThe most expensive residential streets in Paris in 2018 by average price per square meter were Avenue Montaigne (8th arrondissement), at 22,372 Euros per square meter; Place Dauphine (1st arrondissement; 20,373 euros) and Rue de Furstemberg (6th arrondissement) at 18,839 Euros per square meter. The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).Sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date. Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than \u00cele-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire \u00cele-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one. Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 24 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 26 percent in the 14th arrondissement and 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement, on the poorer southwest and northern edges of the city.On the night of 8\u20139 February 2019, during a period of cold weather, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.\n\n\n", "20": "\n\nAside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris' administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. This problem was 'resolved' when its parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed \"\u00cele-de-France\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the \u00cele-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration. Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris came into existence.Paris' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs m\u00e9sentente when he became head of the Paris region in 1961: two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban \"villes nouvelles\" (\"new cities\") and the RER commuter train network. Many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population: These districts were socially mixed at first, but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s). Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.These areas, quartiers sensibles (\"sensitive quarters\"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in \u00c9vry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.The Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.\n\n\n", "21": "\n\nThe official estimated population of the City of Paris was 2,206,488 as of 1 January 2019, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. This is a decline of 59,648 from 2015, close to the total population of the 5th arrondissement.  Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks. This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, to the departure of middle-class residents. and partly to the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".\n\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017. It declined again in 2018.\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglom\u00e9ration Parisienne, and statistically as a unit\u00e9 urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's 2017 population of 10,784,830 made it the largest urban area in the European Union. City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire urbaine de Paris (\"urban area\", but a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area), that had a 2017 population of 12,628,266, a number 19% the population of France, and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.\n\n\n", "22": "\nAccording to the 2012 French census, 586,163 residents of the City of Paris, or 26.2 percent, and 2,782,834 residents of the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France), or 23.4 percent, were born outside of metropolitan France (the last figure up from 22.4% at the 2007 census). 26,700 of these in the City of Paris and 210,159 in the Paris Region were people born in Overseas France (more than two-thirds of whom in the French West Indies) and are therefore not counted as immigrants since they were legally French citizens at birth.A further 103,648 in the City of Paris and in 412,114 in the Paris Region were born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth. This concerns in particular the many Christians and Jews from North Africa who moved to France and Paris after the times of independence and are not counted as immigrants due to their being born French citizens. The remaining group, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under French law. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific. Note that the immigrants from the Americas and the South Pacific in Paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.In the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific. These last two groups of immigrants are again vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in the Americas and the South Pacific.In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France).\n\n\n", "23": "\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world.

In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish, and 25 percent as without religion.\nAccording to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.

The story is similar in the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.At the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.The Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 p\u00f4les d'emplois or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or quartier central des affaires; it is in the western part of the City of Paris, in the 2nd, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 18th arrondissements. In 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the \u00cele-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La D\u00e9fense, just west of the city, where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La D\u00e9fense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.The top ten French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2018 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region; six in the central business district of the City of Paris; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La D\u00e9fense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt.

While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011, the Paris region's GDP accounted for 30 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.The Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.). The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La D\u00e9fense business district places Paris' economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, La D\u00e9fense and the Val de Seine. While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.In the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.Station F is a business incubator for startups, located in 13th arrondissement of Paris.

Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology, and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages. The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.

Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the City of Paris and 8.8 percent in the \u00cele-de-France region in the first trimester of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants live.While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than \u20ac977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; 24 percent in the 18th, 22 percent in the 20th and 18 percent in the 10th. In the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line; 8 percent in the 6th arrondissement; and 9 percent in the 16th arrondissement.\n\n\n", "29": "\n\nGreater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received 38 million visitors in 2019, a record, measured by hotel arrivals.

Paris has long been famous for its grand hotels. The Hotel Meurice, opened for British travellers in 1817, was one of the first luxury hotels in Paris. The arrival of the railways and the Paris Exposition of 1855 brought the first flood of tourists and the first modern grand hotels; the H\u00f4tel du Louvre (now an antiques marketplace) in 1855; the Grand Hotel (now the InterContinental Paris Le Grand Hotel) in 1862; and the H\u00f4tel Continental in 1878.

As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\". Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.\n\nParis was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, \u00c9douard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as G\u00e9ricault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907. Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production.\nThe most prestigious names of French and foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era, are Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty \u2013 Liberty Enlightening the World), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n", "34": "\nThe inventor Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Ni\u00e9pce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s.  The work of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eug\u00e8ne Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Ch\u00e9ret, Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.\n\n\n", "35": "\n\nThe Louvre received 9.6 million visitors in 2019, ranking it the most visited museum in the world., though that number dropped to 2.7 million visitors in 2020, due to the COVID virus.  Its treasures include the Mona Lisa (La Joconde), the Venus de Milo statue, Liberty Leading the People.  The second-most visited museum in the city, with 3.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne. The third most visited Paris museum, in a building constructed for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900 as the Orsay railway station, was the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, which had 3.3 million visitors in 2019. The Orsay displays French art of the 19th century, including major collections of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large Water Lilies murals. The Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art, including the famous tapestry cycle of The Lady and the Unicorn. The Guimet Museum, or Mus\u00e9e national des arts asiatiques, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Mus\u00e9e Picasso, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin and the Mus\u00e9e national Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\n\nParis hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie at La Villette. It attracted 2.2 million visitors in 2018. The National Museum of Natural History located near the Jardin des plantes attracted two million visitors in 2018. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. The military history of France, from the Middle Ages to World War II, is vividly presented by displays at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e at Les Invalides, near the tomb of Napoleon. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris. There are also notable private museums; The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne. It received 1.1 million visitors in 2018.\n\n\n", "36": "\n\nThe largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Op\u00e9ra Garnier (historical Paris Op\u00e9ra) and modern Op\u00e9ra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern. In middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Op\u00e9ra-Comique (which still exists), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville). Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913.\n\nTheatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal at 2 rue de Richelieu, next to the Louvre. of Other famous theatres include the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe, next to the Luxembourg Gardens, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador, and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9-Montparnasse.The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and \u00c9dith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Berg\u00e8re. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.\nThe Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.\n\n\n", "37": "\n\nThe first book printed in France, Epistolae (\"Letters\"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Moli\u00e8re, Racine, several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the caf\u00e9s and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais.\nDuring the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, \u00c9mile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Mis\u00e9rables, written while he was in exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, and, in the 1970s, Milan Kundera. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano (who lives in Paris), based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s\u20131970s.Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.\n\n\n", "38": "\n\nIn the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouv\u00e8res of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.\nRomantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz (La Symphonie fantastique), Charles Gounod (Faust), Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (Samson et Delilah), L\u00e9o Delibes (Lakm\u00e9) and Jules Massenet (Tha\u00efs), among others. Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy (Suite bergamasque, and its well-known third movement, Clair de lune, La Mer, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande), Erik Satie (Gymnop\u00e9dies, \"Je te veux\", Gnossiennes, Parade) and Maurice Ravel (Miroirs, Bol\u00e9ro, La valse, L'heure espagnole). Several foreign-born composers, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (Poland), Franz Liszt (Hungary), Jacques Offenbach (Germany), Niccol\u00f2 Paganini (Italy), and Igor Stravinsky (Russia), established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris.\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle \u00e0 roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s.Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the caf\u00e9s of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf\u2014a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars. Other singers\u2014of similar style\u2014include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet.\nParis has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s. The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and social status for many minorities.\n\n\n", "39": "\n\nThe movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Caf\u00e9 on 28 December 1895. Many of Paris' concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris' largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Biblioth\u00e8que with 20 screens and UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (r\u00e9alisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated. On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.\n\n\n", "40": "\n\nSince the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand V\u00e9four in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period. The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, Maison Dor\u00e9e and the Caf\u00e9 Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and \u00c9mile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.Today, due to Paris' cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants. The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick All\u00e9no and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.\n\nIn addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The caf\u00e9 arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian caf\u00e9s were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Caf\u00e9 Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially Caf\u00e9 de la Rotonde and Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9 in Montparnasse and Caf\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like caf\u00e9s, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\n\n\n", "41": "\n\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients). It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar. The other fashion capitals of the world, Milan, London, and New York also host fashion weeks. Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Or\u00e9al as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e9s, and Cartier. Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Seine.\n\n\n", "42": "\n\nBastille Day, a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the Eiffel Tower.Some other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, a festive event that lasts from mid-July to mid-August when the Right Bank of the Seine is converted into a temporary beach with sand, deck chairs and palm trees; Journ\u00e9es du Patrimoine, F\u00eate de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cin\u00e9ma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and F\u00eate des jardins. The Carnaval de Paris, one of the oldest festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages.\n\n\n", "43": "\n\nParis is the d\u00e9partement with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France, while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the \u00cele-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.\nThe Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes \u00e9coles \u2013 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands \u00e9tablissements. Most of the grandes \u00e9coles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement. There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the Paris Institute of Technology which comprises several colleges such as \u00c9cole Polytechnique, \u00c9cole des Mines, AgroParisTech, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris, Arts et M\u00e9tiers, and \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris' 7th arrondissement, the most prestigious university for social sciences, the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales is located in Paris' 6th arrondissement and the most prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris' 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA department of the Paris-Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Paris is also home to several of France's most famous high-schools such as Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly and Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet. The National Institute of Sport and Physical Education, located in the 12th arrondissement, is both a physical education institute and high-level training centre for elite athletes.\n\n\n", "44": "\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (BnF) operates public libraries in Paris, among them the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Op\u00e9ra Library, and Arsenal Library. There are three public libraries in the 4th arrondissement. The Forney Library, in the Marais district, is dedicated to the decorative arts; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building, and has a large collection on French literature; and the Biblioth\u00e8que historique de la ville de Paris, also in Le Marais, contains the Paris historical research service. The Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library is in 5th arrondissement; designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s, it contains a rare book and manuscript division. Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine, in the 6th arrondissement, is the oldest public library in France. The M\u00e9diath\u00e8que Musicale Mahler in the 8th arrondissement opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand Library (nicknamed Tr\u00e8s Grande Biblioth\u00e8que) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.There are several academic libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library in the 5th arrondissement is the largest university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ib\u00e9riques. Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo da Vinci University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the Ren\u00e9 Descartes University Library.\n\n\n", "45": "\n\nParis' most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis. It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the French national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Fran\u00e7ais rugby team. In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Fran\u00e7ais Paris.\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Two UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000 and 2006 editions. Paris has most recently been the host for UEFA Euro 2016, both at the Parc des Princes in the city proper and also at Stade de France, with the latter hosting the opening match and final.\nThe final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris. Since 1975, the race has finished on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.Tennis is another popular sport in Paris and throughout France; the French Open, held every year on the red clay of the Roland Garros National Tennis Centre, is one of the four Grand Slam events of the world professional tennis tour. The 17,000-seat Bercy Arena (officially named AccorHotels Arena and formerly known as the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy) is the venue for the annual Paris Masters ATP Tour tennis tournament and has been a frequent site of national and international tournaments in basketball, boxing, cycling, handball, ice hockey, show jumping and other sports. The Bercy Arena also hosted the 2017 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, together with Cologne, Germany. The final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1951 and EuroBasket 1999 were also played in Paris, the latter at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy.\nThe basketball team Levallois Metropolitans plays some of its games at the 4,000 capacity Stade Pierre de Coubertin. Another top-level professional team, Nanterre 92, plays in Nanterre.\n\n\n", "46": "\n\n\n", "47": "\n\nParis is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'\u00cele-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region. The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the M\u00e9tro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.\n\n\n", "48": "\n\nA central hub of the national rail network, Paris' six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: the TGV serving four high-speed rail lines, the normal speed Corail trains, and the suburban rails (Transilien).\n\n\n", "49": "\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's M\u00e9tro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily through 16 lines, 303 stations (385 stops) and 220 km (136.7 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines (A, B, C, D, and E), 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area.Over \u20ac26.5 billion will be invested over the next 15 years to extend the M\u00e9tro network into the suburbs, with notably the Grand Paris Express project.\nIn addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: Line T1 runs from Asni\u00e8res-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, Line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles, Line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes, Line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte d'Asni\u00e8res, Line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles, Line T6 runs from Ch\u00e2tillon to Viroflay, Line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, Line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, all of which are operated by the RATP Group, and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF. Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.\n\n\n", "50": "\n\nParis is a major international air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle, Paris\u2013Orly and Beauvais\u2013Till\u00e9 Airport. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014. There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows.\nOrly Airport, located in the southern suburbs of Paris, replaced Le Bourget as the principal airport of Paris from the 1950s to the 1980s. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993. For the year 2017 it was the 5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France. Beauvais-Till\u00e9 Airport, located 69 kilometres (43 miles) north of Paris' city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair.\nDomestically, air travel between Paris and some of France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg has been in a large measure replaced by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014. After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.Internationally, air traffic has increased markedly in recent years between Paris and the Gulf airports, the emerging nations of Africa, Russia, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and mainland China, whereas noticeable decline has been recorded between Paris and the British Isles, Egypt, Tunisia, and Japan.\n\n\n", "51": "\n\nThe city is also the most important hub of France's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways.\n\n\n", "52": "\nThe Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhone, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.\n\n\n", "53": "\n\nThere are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include piste cyclable (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and bande cyclable (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles. Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a bike sharing system called V\u00e9lib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations, which can be rented for short and medium distances including one way trips.\n\n\n", "54": "\nElectricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. As of 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the \u00cele-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent Nuclear Power Plant (35%), trash incineration (9% \u2013 with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh). A quarter of the city's district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from the United States per year.\n\n\n", "55": "\n\nParis in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bi\u00e8vre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital. From 1857, the civil engineer Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation. From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris' principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris' streets. This system is still a major part of Paris' modern water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground passageways dedicated to the evacuation of Paris' liquid wastes.\nIn 1982, Mayor Chirac introduced the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets. The project was abandoned in 2002 for a new and better enforced local law, under the terms of which dog owners can be fined up to \u20ac500 for not removing their dog faeces. The air pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 \u03bcg/m3.\n\n\n", "56": "\n\nParis today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees. Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden (created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre between 1664 and 1672) and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate. The Jardin des plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by Louis XIII's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants.Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters. Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007). One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks.\nWeekly Parkruns take place in the Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Montsouris \n\n\n", "57": "\n\nDuring the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines outside the \"Porte d'Enfer\" city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement. The process of moving bones from the Cimeti\u00e8re des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.\nAfter a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of P\u00e8re Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Bagneux.

Paris facts.Lutetia, as the city was then called, became Roman in 52 BC (before Christ). Lutetia was a prosperous town of about 8 000 inhabitants until 280 when Lutetia was first destroyed by barbarians. During the roman times, Lyon was the capital of France, then named the Gaul. The only noticeable remains of these times are the Roman Baths in Musee de Cluny, the Museum of Middle Ages (web site, Paris map) and the Lutetia Arenas (Paris map). The greatest Roman monuments in France are the Pont du Gard, the Nimes Arenas, the Orange Theater, all of them in the Provence region.With 200 000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80 000 inhabitants.Until 1358, the French Kings had their Palace in what is now La Conciergerie on Ile de la Cite. They then moved to the Louvre, a defensive fortress at the time. Faithful Parisians had already built Notre Dame Cathedral, Sainte Chapelle, Saint Germain des Pres, Saint Denis. The Sorbonne was established since 1253 as a famous European university.With 400 000 inhabitants, the city was the most populous in the world. Under Louis XIV, also named Sun King, Paris extended herself to Le Marais and Les Invalides. Louis XIV built the Versailles Palace near Paris as the testimony of his glory and power. Paris became the prominent European city for luxury, fashion, fine food and wine. She still is.The Eiffel Tower was designed for the 1889 world exhibition to celebrate the progress of technology. She was built in just two years by 132 workers and 50 engineers. The Tower was much criticized by Parisians when she was built. The Eiffel Tower was planned to be demolished in 1909. She was saved at the very last moment as she could be turned into a telecommunication tower.

Most famously, the Beat Hotel was home to Burroughs, Ginsberg, Corso, and others. There was also the Mistral Bookshop, owned by George Whitman, where writers with nowhere to stay and no money to eat could sleep over for free. Most of the visiting Beats took advantage of Whitman\u2019s hospitality at some point. Burroughs wrote and published some of his greatest work in Paris, and Ginsberg began writing \u201cKaddish\u201d here.

Three years later, he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid but, once there, felt there was more to learn about the latest currents in Paris from French art magazines than from his teachers, whom he believed were out of touch. (On a brief excursion to Paris with his father in 1926, he called on his idol, Pablo Picasso. \u201cI have come to see you before visiting the Louvre,\u201d Dal\u00ed said. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d Picasso replied.) When it came time for his year-end oral exam in art history at the academy, Dal\u00ed balked at the trio of examiners. \u201cI am very sorry,\u201d he declared, \u201cbut I am infinitely more intelligent than these three professors, and I therefore refuse to be examined by them. I know this subject much too well.\u201d Academy officials expelled him without a diploma.It was Spanish artist Joan Mir\u00f3, a fellow Catalan allied to the Surrealists, who would bring Dal\u00ed to their attention. Mir\u00f3 even had his own Paris dealer look at Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings on a visit to Figueres. Afterward, Dal\u00ed wrote to his friend the Spanish playwright and poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, whom he had met during their student days in Madrid, that Mir\u00f3 \u201cthinks that I\u2019m much better than all the young painters in Paris put together, and he\u2019s written to me telling me that I\u2019ve got everything set up for me there in order to make a great hit.\u201d Mir\u00f3 continued to drum up interest in Dal\u00ed\u2019s work in Paris, and when the artist arrived there in 1929, Mir\u00f3 introduced him to many of the Surrealists.", "This book traces the spread of a global anti-imperialism from the vantage point of Paris between the two World Wars, where countless future leaders of Third World countries spent formative stints. Exploring the local social context in which these emergent activists moved, the study delves into assassination plots allegedly hatched by Chinese students, demonstrations by Latin American nationalists, and the everyday lives of Algerian, Senegalese, and Vietnamese workers. On the basis of police reports and other primary sources, the book foregrounds the role of migration and interaction as driving forces enabling challenges to the imperial world order, weaving together the stories of peoples of three continents. Drawing on the scholarship of twentieth-century imperial, international, and global history as well as migration, race, and ethnicity in France, it ultimately proposes a new understanding of the roots of the Third World idea.\"Anti-Imperial Metropolis will reorient the way we think about the global intellectual and political history of decolonization and nationalism, and deserves to be essential reading in both undergraduate and graduate courses on modern international affairs. Michael Goebel's thought-provoking account of the role played by migrant intellectuals from diverse regions of the world living in interwar Paris in creating the post-imperial imagination of the world order helps us better understand the curious links among nationalism, internationalism, and social history of immigration to Europe from the colonies. This is indeed one of the best books I have read in recent times.\"\nCemil Aydin, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\"Michael Goebel's masterful study on anticolonial activities of migrant groups in Paris during the interwar period is an outstanding contribution to the field of global history and to the historiography of decolonization. It is the first book that analyzes the complexity of a major city that became a hub of global anti-imperial consciousness and a crossroad of global migrations. It very nicely links the 'local' with the 'global' beyond abstract statements, but with rich empirical material.\"\nAndreas Eckert, Humboldt University BerlinIntroduction 1.

Conclusion.", "Politicians, historians and protesters gathered in Paris to mark the 50th anniversary of a police crackdown on Algerian anti-war demonstrators that has become one of the most shameful episodes of modern French history.The events of 17 October 1961 are considered a massacre by many Algerians, who claim up to 300 members of their community died at the hands of the Paris police.Afterwards he unveiled a plaque engraved with: \"From this bridge and other bridges in the Paris region, Algerian demonstrators were thrown into the Seine on the 17 October 1961, victims of a blind repression. In their memory.\"Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the mayor of Paris who was born in Tunisia, another former French colony, placed a wreath at the St Michel bridge where there is a plaque marking what his office described as a \"bloody repression\".On the evening of 17 October 1961, at the height of the Franco-Algerian war, tens of thousands of Algerian protesters, including women and children, from around Paris gathered at various landmarks to demonstrate against what they considered a \"racist and discriminatory\" curfew imposed against them.The mobilisation had been organised by the Paris wing of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN), an organisation that was fighting for Algeria's independence from France and had been accused of carrying out attacks on Paris police that left a dozen dead.It was intended to be a peaceful demonstration, but Maurice Papon, the Paris police chief, ordered his officers to stamp out the protests. As the Algerians gathered, the police acted swiftly and brutally, firing on protesters and arresting an estimated 11,500 who were herded on to buses and taken to makeshift detention centres where many claimed they were beaten and held for days without food.Though nobody could have foreseen the extent of the violence, tensions between the Paris police and the city's Algerian community had been building up after the curfew was introduced in response to the police deaths.\n The massacre that Paris denied \n", "\n\t\t\t\u00a9 Henri Garat/Maire de Paris - les emmarchements des berges de Seine\t\tLe maire de Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, et sa premi\u00e8re adjointe, Anne Hidalgo, ont inaugur\u00e9, le 19 juin, la nouvelle promenade de 2,3 km, am\u00e9nag\u00e9e en rive gauche de Seine, du mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay au pont de l\u2019Alma (7\u00e8me arrondissement).

Sarkozy promised a recession-busting, \u20ac35bn investment in new and existing \n  rapid transit systems to help to create a single \"Greater Paris\" from a \n  jumbled conurbation of 12,000,000 people in the space of 10 years. \n\n\"The economic crisis can only be beaten by grand projects,\" M. Sarkozy said. \n  \"There could be no grander project than to create a Greater Paris.\" \n\nIn a speech inaugurating an exhibition of ten architects' visions for a \"Grand \n  Paris\",  President Sarkozy also promised a drive to create a million jobs in \n  the Paris area over 20 years and to build 70,000 homes a year in the capital \n  and its suburbs. He called for a brand new underground station for \n  high-speed, long distance trains at La D\u00e9fense, just west of the city \n  proper, and the plantation of a new forest near Charles de Gaulle airport to \n  absorb carbon emissions. \n\nThere would also be a need, he said, for new \"monuments\" to rival the Eiffel \n  Tower or the Arc de Triomphe. These would be constructed outside the present \n  city boundary to create the image of a single, dynamic, greener and larger \n  \"Paris for the 21st century\".   \n\nTo the disappointment of some, and delight of others, M. Sarkozy side-stepped \n  the anguished question of whether to establish a new political entity for a \n  \"Greater Paris\", to match Greater London. He said that he wanted to create a \n  \"project\" for the whole of the Paris area without becoming bogged down in \n  political arguments. \n\nCritics doubt whether a de facto Greater Paris  can be achieved without an \n  agreement on eroding the administrative boundaries between the city of Paris \n  (pop 2,000,000) and its surrounding suburbs.  President Sarkozy's suggestion \n  yesterday that planning laws should be relaxed to allow the rapid building \n  of new railways, homes and tower blocks also aroused deep suspicions. \n\nThe political and economic barriers and poor transport links between Paris and \n  its \"banlieues\" contributed to the alienation and deprivation which fuelled \n  the suburban riots of November 2005. The British architect Richard Rogers \n  says that he knows \"of no other large city in which the heart is so detached \n  from the limbs\". \n\nLord Rogers' team was one of ten invited by M. Sarkozy to put forward \n  suggestions for the development of a \"Grand Paris\" for the 21st century. The \n  ideas will be on display at the Grand Palais, off the Champs Elys\u00e9es, from \n  tomorrow. \n\nIn his speech opening the exhibition, President Sarkozy promised a ten year \n  programme, starting in 2010 or 2011, to improve rail links between Paris and \n  its two airports and hundreds of satellite towns. He offered Euros 21bn for \n  the \"Big Eight\": a 130 kilometres (80 miles), driverless, 24-hour metro \n  system in the form of two large loops, joining across the centre of the \n  city. \n", "FRANCE: The government is to proceed with the project to build 200 km of new metro lines by 2030 to serve the outer suburbs of the capital, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announced in a speech given on March 6. Following a review of the programme inherited from the Sarkozy administration, Ayrault said that the Nouveau Grand Paris programme was \u2018unprecedented in its ambition and it is funded\u2019.\nThe Grand Paris Express project to build a network of orbital automatic metro lines now has a budget of \u20ac26\u22c55bn, and Ayrault said that construction of the various routes would be launched in parallel. The first public inquiry is due to start later this year for work to start on Line 15 from Noisy-Champs to Pont-de-S\u00e8vres in 2015.\nThis route should be in service by 2020 when work would be nearing completion on a further section of Line 15 from Noisy to Le Bourget and on Line 18 from Massy-Palaiseau to Saclay. To connect with these new orbital routes Line 11 of the Paris metro network is to be extended eastwards to Noisy-Champs, while Line 14 is be extended northwards to Saint-Denis-Pleyel and to Orly south of the capital.\nThe Nouveau Grand Paris programme also includes \u20ac7bn to improve existing routes by 2017, which is expected to create 57 000 jobs. This will include modernisation of RER lines B, C and D, extension of metro Line 4 to Montrouge by 2013 and the opening of light rail route T8 from Saint-Denis to \u00c9pinay and Villetaneuse in 2014. Refurbishment of the major interchange at Ch\u00e2telet-Les Halles is planned for 2016, followed by the extension of metro Line 14 to Mairie de Saint-Ouen in 2017 and the construction of the Clichy \u2013 Montfermeil branch of light rail route T4.\n", "Le m\u00e9tro automatique du Grand Paris est constitu\u00e9 d\u2019environ 175km de lignes nouvelles, et de pr\u00e8s de 57 gares.

People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the river\u2019s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 bc. The modern city has spread from the island (the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9) and far beyond both banks of the Seine.Paris occupies a central position in the rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one of eight d\u00e9partements of the \u00cele-de-France administrative region. It is by far the country\u2019s most important centre of commerce and culture. Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan area, 890 square miles (2,300 square km). Pop. (1999) city, 2,125,246; (2005 est.) city, 2,153,600; urban agglomeration, 9,854,000.For centuries Paris has been one of the world\u2019s most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation. Its sobriquet \u201cthe City of Light\u201d (\u201cla Ville Lumi\u00e8re\u201d), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual pursuits.Paris\u2019s site at a crossroads of both water and land routes significant not only to France but also to Europe has had a continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman administration, in the 1st century bc, the original site on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 was designated the capital of the Parisii tribe and territory. The Frankish king Clovis I had taken Paris from the Gauls by ad 494 and later made his capital there. Under Hugh Capet (ruled 987\u2013996) and the Capetian dynasty the preeminence of Paris was firmly established, and Paris became the political and cultural hub as modern France took shape. France has long been a highly centralized country, and Paris has come to be identified with a powerful central state, drawing to itself much of the talent and vitality of the provinces.The three main parts of historical Paris are defined by the Seine. At its centre is the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cit\u00e9 connotes the nucleus of the ancient city). The Seine\u2019s Left Bank (Rive Gauche) has traditionally been the seat of intellectual life, and its Right Bank (Rive Droite) contains the heart of the city\u2019s economic life, but the distinctions have become blurred in recent decades. The fusion of all these functions at the centre of France and, later, at the centre of an empire, resulted in a tremendously vital environment. In this environment, however, the emotional and intellectual climate that was created by contending powers often set the stage for great violence in both the social and political arenas\u2014the years 1358, 1382, 1588, 1648, 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1870 being notable for such events. (For more information, see below History; see France: History.)In its centuries of growth Paris has for the most part retained the circular shape of the early city. Its boundaries have spread outward to engulf the surrounding towns (bourgs), usually built around monasteries or churches and often the site of a market. From the mid-14th to the mid-16th century, the city\u2019s growth was mainly eastward; since then it has been westward. It comprises 20 arrondissements (municipal districts), each of which has its own mayor, town hall, and particular features. The numbering begins in the heart of Paris and continues in the spiraling shape of a snail shell, ending to the far east. Parisians refer to the arrondissements by number as the first (premier), second (deuxi\u00e8me), third (troisi\u00e8me), and so on. Adaptation to the problems of urbanization\u2014such as immigration, housing, social infrastructure, public utilities, suburban development, and zoning\u2014has produced the vast urban agglomeration.Paris is positioned at the centre of the \u00cele-de-France region, which is crossed by the Seine, Oise, and Marne rivers. The city is ringed with great forests of beech and oak; they are called the \u201clungs of Paris,\u201d for they help to purify the air in the heavily industrialized region. The city proper is small; no corner is farther than about 6 miles (10 km) from the square in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral. It occupies a depression hollowed out by the Seine, and the surrounding heights have been respected as the limits of the city. Elevation varies from 430 feet (130 metres) at the butte of Montmartre, in the north, to 85 feet (26 metres) in the Grenelle area, in the southwest.The Seine flows for about 8 miles (13 km) through the centre of the city and 10 of the 20 arrondissements. It enters the city at the southeast corner, flows northwestward, and turns gradually southwestward, eventually leaving Paris at the southwest corner. As a result, what starts out as the stream\u2019s east bank becomes its north bank and ends as the west bank, and the Parisians therefore adopted the simple, unchanging designation of Right Bank and Left Bank (when facing downstream). Specific places, however, are usually indicated by arrondissement or by quarter (quartier).The garden effect of the Seine\u2019s open waters and its tree-lined banks foster in part the appearance of Paris as a city well-endowed with green spaces. Tens of thousands of trees (mostly plane trees, with a scattering of chestnuts) line the streets as well, and numerous public parks, gardens, and squares dot the city. Most of the parks and gardens of the modern central city are on land that formerly was reserved for the kings on the old city\u2019s outskirts. Under Napoleon III, who had been impressed by London\u2019s parks while living in Britain, two ancient royal military preserves at the approaches to Paris were made into \u201cEnglish\u201d parks\u2014the Bois de Boulogne to the west and the Bois de Vincennes to the east. Moreover, during his reign a large area of land was laid out in promenades and garden squares. Under Mayor Jacques Chirac in the late 20th century, the municipal government initiated efforts to create new parks, and such projects continued into the 21st century.What made you want to look up \"Paris\"?

Every season pays tribute to Paris and highlights its charms, be it the sun caressing its pale fa\u00e7ades, or the rain reflecting the night\u2019s gleam. To the sweet music of romance or a festive beat, compose your own score for your trip to the city, depending on the time of year and the whims of the weather.This is the season where Paris seems to reawaken, with its avenues fringed with new green shoots and its trees in flower. The days are getting longer, as are the opening times of museums, and the high season is just around the corner. There\u2019s a holiday feeling in the air and the sweet smell of candy floss pervades the pathways of the Foire du Tr\u00f4ne funfair. People venture out and about in the parks and gardens and along the river banks, strolling, cycling or skating.When the summer season is at its height, rest and relaxation and \u201cjoie de vivre\u201d bask in the sun, on the caf\u00e9 terraces, in the parks and on the \u201cbeaches\u201d by the Seine. Picnics abound and gourmets melt for the best ice cream in Paris. On the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, the 14 July parades and the cyclists triumph. Cinema and music celebrate: free films and concerts thrill the la capital, which takes on its summer scenes.When you see the avenues and parks take on their autumn reflections, and the soft light of the street lamps sets aglow the carpet of fallen leaves, it\u2019s an inspiring sight. The days may be getting shorter, but the colours are blooming. This is not only the time to return to school, but also a renewal of culture. Autumn has its own festival and the major trade fairs draw the crowds. Towards the end of November, Paris already sparkles with Christmas decorations.Snow occasionally covers the rooftops of Paris with its mantle, reminiscent of the Impressionist paintings by Caillebotte. Christmas dresses up the main avenues with its sparkle, markets and appealing window displays spring up around the city. It is a pleasure to dive into the cosy warmth of its restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Take a tasty break for hot chocolate between two museums or after a few pirouettes on the open-air ice rinks. From January to March, this is the charm of off-season Paris.To know the weather forecast in Paris, for today and the days ahead, click here.Paris is not considered to be an unbreathable capital, as you might describe Athens, Mexico, or even London, once known as the \u201cBig Smoke\u201d. The quality of the air is something that cannot be ignored: as it may cause irritation of our airways or breathing difficulties and also contributes to the erosion of monuments. For these reasons Paris City Council makes every effort to bring a breath of fresh air to a city that still suffers from a surplus of traffic.Since 1954, the air in Paris is being constantly monitored, a job entrusted since 1979 to the [AIRPARIF] organization, under the authorization of the Department for the Environment. The quality of the air is displayed on a daily basis on electronic boards throughout the city, on a scale from 1 (very good) to 10 (very poor) corresponding to international standards set down by the OMS and the European Commission.Among the steps taken by the City of Paris to fight against atmospheric pollution, can be highlighted: the increase in environmental-friendly municipal vehicles and buses (electricity or natural gas), bicycle paths, \u201cgreen\u201d districts with reduced traffic, more convivial public areas along the busier routes, as well as public transport improvements including the installation of exclusive bus lanes and the tram project for the ring-roads. The local authorities also encourage Parisians to use public transport as much as possible, and develop the activities of cycling and rollerblading.\u00a9 2010 Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All rights reserved", "The winter months in Paris have a bad rap for being gloomy, dark, perpetually rainy and low-key, but with holiday festivities taking the city by storm for a good part of the season, Paris literally lights up more than ever. What's more, if you enjoy indoor activities such as visiting museums and cathedrals or spending a few hours reading peacefully in a traditional Parisian cafe while nursing a good cafe creme or chocolat chaud, or perhaps ice-skating in the open air, a winter sojourn in Paris may in fact be ideal for you.Despite appearances, there's plenty to do during your winter trip. As I mention above, many of these activities will be indoors, but provided that you pack correctly and bundle up, and it's not too wet out, a wintery walk through a gorgeous Parisian park or an evening stroll around the brilliantly lit streets can be mesmerizing and peaceful.", "This is the place to\u00a0find out whether Paris really is so rainy, or if Nice is so sunny, or just how much snow to expect in the Alps in January. Find out which months are rainiest in various cities, and what the average temperatures are throughout France. Here are details about weather and climate in France.Although France is just the size of Texas, it is the largest country in western Europe and consequently its weather varies hugely from region to region and\u00a0from city to city. Paris is quite far north, so\u00a0can have downright chilly days, even in July. The Mediterranean beaches are close to the Alps and Pyrenees, and the climates on the\u00a0coast versus mountains is quite different.\u00a0Nice can be balmy in the middle of winter and\u00a0its geographical location means that you can swim in the morning, then jump into your car and head up to the small Alpine resorts for a few hours...MORE skiing before getting back to the warmer city.The temperatures in France aren't all created equal. Some places have a mild climate, and others can be extremely cold at times. Did you know that Nice and Perpignan are among the warmest cities, while Strasbourg and Rouen are among the coldest? Paris also has a reputation for some really cold snaps of weather, so go prepared.Average precipitation and rainfall in France can reveal some surprising facts. While there are images of Paris being incredibly rainy, it actually has one of the lowest precipitation totals of France's major cities. Nice, known for its sunny climate, actually has among the highest precipitation totals but only in certain months of the year.

Dans un d\u00e9lai de trois mois \u00e0 compter de la transmission de la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration engageant la proc\u00e9dure d'\u00e9laboration, le repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat dans la r\u00e9gion porte \u00e0 la connaissance de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments utiles ainsi que les objectifs \u00e0 prendre en compte en mati\u00e8re de diversit\u00e9 de l'habitat, de r\u00e9partition \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e des diff\u00e9rents types de logements, de renouvellement du parc immobilier et d'accroissement du nombre de logements et de places d'h\u00e9bergement pour l'application du neuvi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a du m\u00eame article L. 302-1. Le projet de plan, arr\u00eat\u00e9 par le conseil de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, est transmis aux communes et conseils de territoire, qui disposent d'un d\u00e9lai de deux mois pour faire conna\u00eetre leur avis. Au vu de ces avis, le conseil de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris d\u00e9lib\u00e8re \u00e0 nouveau sur le projet et le transmet au repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat dans la r\u00e9gion, qui dispose d'un d\u00e9lai de trois mois pour faire conna\u00eetre son avis. Dans ce d\u00e9lai, celui-ci le soumet pour avis au comit\u00e9 r\u00e9gional de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement. En cas d'avis d\u00e9favorable ou de r\u00e9serves \u00e9mises par le comit\u00e9 r\u00e9gional de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement ou si le repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat estime que le projet de plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement ne r\u00e9pond pas aux objectifs de r\u00e9partition \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e et diversifi\u00e9e de l'offre de logements, de renouvellement du parc immobilier et d'accroissement du nombre de logements et de places d'h\u00e9bergement n\u00e9cessaires, le repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat peut adresser des demandes motiv\u00e9es de modifications \u00e0 la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, qui en d\u00e9lib\u00e8re. Le plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement est approuv\u00e9 par le conseil de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris. La d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration publi\u00e9e approuvant le plan devient ex\u00e9cutoire deux mois apr\u00e8s sa transmission au repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat. Si, dans ce d\u00e9lai, le repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat notifie au pr\u00e9sident du conseil de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris les demandes de modifications, mentionn\u00e9es au neuvi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a du pr\u00e9sent V, qu'il estime n\u00e9cessaire d'apporter au plan, le plan ne devient ex\u00e9cutoire qu'\u00e0 compter de la publication et de la transmission au repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat de la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration apportant les modifications demand\u00e9es.

La m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris communique pour avis au repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat dans la r\u00e9gion et au comit\u00e9 r\u00e9gional de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement un bilan de la r\u00e9alisation du plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement trois ans et six ans apr\u00e8s son approbation. A l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai de six ans \u00e0 compter de son approbation, le conseil de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, en tenant compte du bilan mentionn\u00e9 au douzi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a du pr\u00e9sent V, d\u00e9lib\u00e8re sur l'opportunit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9vision de ce plan. Il peut \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 tout moment dans les m\u00eames conditions. Pour mettre en \u0153uvre le plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement, la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris r\u00e9alise des programmes d'am\u00e9nagement et de logement. Elle peut demander \u00e0 l'Etat de la faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier, par d\u00e9cret en Conseil d'Etat, de comp\u00e9tences d\u00e9rogatoires pour la cr\u00e9ation et la r\u00e9alisation des zones d'am\u00e9nagement concert\u00e9 et la d\u00e9livrance d'autorisations d'urbanisme. La m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris peut \u00e9galement proposer \u00e0 l'Etat, pour la r\u00e9alisation de programmes de construction et de r\u00e9novation de logements ou des \u00e9quipements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 ces logements, d'engager une proc\u00e9dure de projet d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La proposition est adopt\u00e9e par le conseil de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris et transmise au repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat dans le d\u00e9partement int\u00e9ress\u00e9. L'Etat peut mettre \u00e0 la disposition de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris les \u00e9tablissements publics d'am\u00e9nagement de l'Etat. V bis.-L'Etat peut transf\u00e9rer, \u00e0 la demande de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l'am\u00e9nagement, l'entretien et la gestion de grands \u00e9quipements et infrastructures. Ces transferts sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u00e0 titre gratuit et ne donnent lieu au versement d'aucune indemnit\u00e9 ou taxe, ni d'aucun salaire, ni d'aucuns droits ou honoraires. Le transfert est autoris\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret. Une convention conclue entre l'Etat et la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris pr\u00e9cise les modalit\u00e9s du transfert. VI.-Afin de favoriser la construction de logements neufs, la r\u00e9habilitation des logements anciens et la r\u00e9sorption de l'habitat indigne, l'Etat peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer, par convention, \u00e0 la demande de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, d\u00e8s lors qu'elle dispose d'un plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement ex\u00e9cutoire, les comp\u00e9tences mentionn\u00e9es aux 1\u00b0 et 2\u00b0 du pr\u00e9sent VI : Pour les demandeurs demeurant dans le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris reconnus, au moment de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de la pr\u00e9sente comp\u00e9tence, comme prioritaires en application de l'article L. 441-2-3-1 dudit code, l'Etat continue de verser le produit des astreintes au Fonds national d'accompagnement vers et dans le logement institu\u00e9 en application de l'article L. 300-2 du m\u00eame code ; Cette d\u00e9l\u00e9gation est r\u00e9gie par une convention conclue pour une dur\u00e9e de six ans, renouvelable. Elle peut \u00eatre d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le repr\u00e9sentant de l'Etat dans le d\u00e9partement \u00e0 l'issue d'un d\u00e9lai de trois ans lorsque les r\u00e9sultats de son ex\u00e9cution sont insuffisants au regard des objectifs d\u00e9finis par la convention. Elle peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, dans les m\u00eames d\u00e9lais, en cas de non-respect des engagements de l'Etat. VII.-L'Etat peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer, \u00e0 la demande de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, d\u00e8s lors qu'elle dispose d'un plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l'habitat et de l'h\u00e9bergement ex\u00e9cutoire, tout ou partie des comp\u00e9tences suivantes : La m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris propose \u00e0 l'Etat et aux collectivit\u00e9s territoriales un plan de rationalisation des outils d'am\u00e9nagement et des syndicats intervenant dans son ressort territorial.", "\n\t\t\t\t\tVous \u00eates dans :\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAccueil>\nLes autres textes l\u00e9gislatifs et r\u00e9glementaires>\nD\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2015-1212 du 30 septembre 2015 constatant le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre fixant le si\u00e8ge et d\u00e9signant le comptable public de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nPublics concern\u00e9s : collectivit\u00e9s territoriales, services de l'Etat int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, repr\u00e9sentants de l'Etat, usagers.Objet : constat du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris, fixation de l'adresse de son si\u00e8ge et d\u00e9signation de son comptable public.Entr\u00e9e en vigueur : le texte entre en vigueur le 1er janvier 2016.R\u00e9f\u00e9rences : le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9cret est pris en application des articles L. 5219-1 et suivants du code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des collectivit\u00e9s territoriales, dans leur version issue de l'article 59 de la loi n\u00b0 2015-991 du 7 ao\u00fbt 2015, portant nouvelle organisation territoriale de la R\u00e9publique (NOTRe).

Dot\u00e9e de quatre grandes comp\u00e9tences dont deux lui seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9es avec un an de d\u00e9calage, elle devrait s\u2019organiser en douze territoires dont les p\u00e9rim\u00e8tres seront fix\u00e9s par d\u00e9cret en Conseil d\u2019Etat en d\u00e9cembre 2015.\n\t\t\t\u00a9 Mission de pr\u00e9figuration de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris - La m\u00e9tropole regroupera Paris, les 123 communes de petite couronne et deux villes de grande couronne.\t\tAlors que de plus en plus de voix s\u2019\u00e9levaient pour repousser sa cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un an, la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris verra bien le jour le 1er janvier 2016, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 17 septdecies du projet de loi portant r\u00e9forme territoriale de la R\u00e9publique (Notre), d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9e le 16 juillet par le Parlement. Cet article est une r\u00e9\u00e9criture de l\u2019article 12 de la loi Maptam, cr\u00e9ant ce nouvel \u00e9tablissement public de coop\u00e9ration intercommunale (EPCI) \u00e0 fiscalit\u00e9 propre, englobant Paris, les 123 communes de petite couronne et pour l\u2019instant, deux villes de grande couronne :  Argenteuil (Val d\u2019Oise) et Paray-Vieille-Poste (Essonne), une liste qui n\u2019est pas encore stabilis\u00e9e, la loi Notre ayant rouvert un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un mois, \u00e0 partir de sa promulgation, pour permettre aux communes a\u00e9roportuaires de se prononcer.La m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris (MGP) sera finalement dot\u00e9e d\u2019un conseil m\u00e9tropolitain d\u2019environ 210 \u00e9lus (209 \u00e0 ce jour), beaucoup plus resserr\u00e9 que dans les premi\u00e8res versions de la loi (pr\u00e8s de 350 membres), dont le si\u00e8ge sera situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris. Pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019effectif de ce conseil, comme le Premier ministre s\u2019y  \u00e9tait engag\u00e9 lors du comit\u00e9 interminist\u00e9riel d\u2019avril sur le Grand Paris, le gouvernement a   d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019aligner sa composition sur le droit applicable aux EPCI \u00e0 fiscalit\u00e9 propre.La MGP dispose de quatre grandes comp\u00e9tences : am\u00e9nagement de l\u2019espace m\u00e9tropolitain, politique locale de l\u2019habitat, d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique et protection de l\u2019air et de l\u2019environnement. Mais les deux premi\u00e8res comp\u00e9tences, sur proposition du gouvernement, ne lui seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9es que le 1er janvier 2017. Elle ne pourra donc pas s\u2019atteler formellement  \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration du sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale (Scot) avant cette date, ni \u00e0 celle du plan m\u00e9tropolitain de l\u2019habitat et de l\u2019h\u00e9bergement (PMHH). Elle pourra, en revanche, d\u00e8s 2016, engager l\u2019\u00e9laboration du plan climat air-\u00e9nergie territorial.  La m\u00e9tropole sera aussi charg\u00e9e de la mise en coh\u00e9rence des r\u00e9seaux de distribution d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, de gaz, de chaleur et de froid. Une commission consultative sera cr\u00e9\u00e9e avec la Ville de Paris et les syndicats intervenant en mati\u00e8re de gaz et d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\nLa m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris devrait en effet s\u2019organiser en douze \u00e9tablissements publics territoriaux (EPT), sans enclave et d\u2019au moins 300\u00a0000\u00a0habitants. Ces nouvelles entit\u00e9s, cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la loi, sont des EPCI sans fiscalit\u00e9 propre (sauf de 2016 \u00e0 2020 o\u00f9 ils percevront la Cotisation fonci\u00e8re des entreprises), soumis aux dispositions applicables aux syndicats de communes.Au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 le Parlement votait le projet de loi Notre, le pr\u00e9fet de r\u00e9gion, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Carenco, pr\u00e9sentait aux \u00e9lus franciliens la carte des 12 futurs territoires envisag\u00e9s. Le projet de d\u00e9cret \u00e9tabli sur la base de cette carte sera soumis en octobre aux communes membres et le p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre des territoires sera fix\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret en Conseil d\u2019Etat courant d\u00e9cembre 2015. La Ville de Paris constitue \u00e0 elle seule un EPT. Par ailleurs, trois communaut\u00e9s d\u2019agglom\u00e9ration existantes conservent leur p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre : Plaine Commune et Est Ensemble, en Seine-Saint-Denis ; Grand Paris Seine Ouest, dans les Hauts-de-Seine.  Il s\u2019agira donc pour elles d\u2019une simple transformation juridique et d\u2019une modification des flux financiers.  Pour la majorit\u00e9 des territoires, le processus de cr\u00e9ation sera plus compliqu\u00e9.Pour aider \u00e0 la mise en place des EPT, la mission de pr\u00e9figuration de la m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des outils \u00e0 destination des administrations communales et intercommunales : un vade-mecum des EPT et une FAQ (Foire aux questions). A partir de septembre, elle devrait proposer aux \u00e9lus de participer \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e9unions qu\u2019ils jugeront n\u00e9cessaires et nommer des r\u00e9f\u00e9rents pour les territoires qui le souhaitent.La m\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris est aussi charg\u00e9e de la mise en coh\u00e9rence des r\u00e9seaux de distribution d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, de gaz, de chaleur et de froid.", "", "L'architecte, \u00e0 la demande du comte, \u00e9leva l'h\u00f4tel entre cour (c\u00f4t\u00e9 rue) et jardin (c\u00f4t\u00e9 Champs Elys\u00e9es), formant le point de d\u00e9part du plan d'urbanisme du faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9.

Lassurance, son architecte favori, fut charg\u00e9 de modifier l'ordonnance de la Chambre de Parade et d'am\u00e9nager le premier \u00e9tage.

Pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins, elle mit en location le rez-de-chauss\u00e9e de l'h\u00f4tel et donna l'autorisation \u00e0 son locataire, un n\u00e9gociant du nom d'Hovyn, d'organiser des bals populaires dans les salons et le jardin.L'Empereur y r\u00e9sida du 1er mars 1809 jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9part pour la campagne d'Autriche, s'installant dans l'appartement de Caroline.

The wood panelling is the work of Michel Lange, who had already decorated the Grand Salon of the H\u00f4tel d\u2019Evreux (today the Ambassadors\u2019 Salon of the Elys\u00e9e Palace. The cornices and the stucco work are by Jean-Martin Pelletier and Jean Herpin. At the time, any \"well-dressed\" person was authorized by the owners to visit these splendors in their absence.A short time later the H\u00f4tel was sold to the Duke of Galliera, Raffaele de Ferrari, member of the Genoese nobility and husband of Marie de Brignole Sale, great niece to the Princess of Monaco. Together they possessed one of the great fortunes of the time; it is claimed that they owned half of Genoa. Founder of the \"Cr\u00e9dit Immobilier de France\", Raffaele financed many of the major construction projects of the second half of the nineteenth century: railroads in Austria, Latin America, Portugal and France (the Paris-Lyons-Marseille line), the digging of the Fr\u00e9jus tunnel and the Suez Canal, the Paris buildings designed by Baron Hausmann... Three years after the fall of Napoleon III (1870), the Duchess proposed that the Count of Paris take up residence at the Rue de Varenne. He came to occupy the ground floor of the H\u00f4tel Matignon. On 14 May 1886, this was the setting of one of the century\u2019s most sumptuous receptions: three thousand guests, the entire aristocracy of France, the diplomatic corps and numerous political figures thronged to celebrate the marriage of Princess Am\u00e9lie, the Count\u2019s daughter, with Carlos, heir to the Portuguese throne. The story goes that, the day of the reception, the President had a sudden desire to visit the Bois de Boulogne, but was unable to leave the Elys\u00e9e because of the congested traffic. The following day, no doubt alarmed by such a large gathering of Monarchists in the Capital, the President of the Council, Monsieur de Freycinet, called for a law exiling pretenders to the French throne. The next week the legislation was passed.The Duchess of Galliera was disenchanted and quit Paris, leaving her mansion to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor, who made it his Embassy in France. But the First World War found the two countries on opposite sides and, confiscated in 1919, the H\u00f4tel Matignon was declared \"enemy property\". On 21 November 1922, after prolonged negotiations, France once more assumed ownership.\nDuring the Second World War, the government moved to Vichy, but on 21 August 1944, it was in Paris that the resistance leader Yvon Mosandal and his companion seized the \"Government Mansion\", the H\u00f4tel Matignon. In their haste they even confused the Avenue Matignon, located on the Right Bank of the Seine, with the H\u00f4tel Matignon, situated on the Left Bank. It was there that, on 25 August, General de Gaulle convened the \"Provisory Council of the Republic\". Subsequent Presidents of the Council followed his example and, his return in 1958, like the new Republic, changed nothing more at Matignon than the occupant\u2019s name, which, instead of President of the Council, became Prime Minister.", "", "", "Depuis les temps les plus anciens, l\u2019\u00eele de la Cit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le centre administratif de Paris, puis des diff\u00e9rents royaumes qui ont fait l\u2019histoire de la France.

An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the \u2018Haussmann period\u2019. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789\u20132010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.In this article, we will consider the case of the evolution of the street network of Paris over more than 200 years with a particular focus on the 19th century, period when Paris experienced large transformations under the guidance of Baron Haussmann24. It would be difficult to describe the social, political, and urbanistic importance and impact of Haussmann works in a few lines here and we refer the interested reader to the existing abundant literature on the subject (see25, and24 and references therein). Essentially, until the middle of the 19th century, central Paris has a medieval structure composed of many small and crowded streets, creating congestion and, according to some contemporaries, probably health problems. In 1852, Napoleon III commissioned Haussmann to modernize Paris by building safer streets, large avenues connected to the new train stations, central or symbolic squares (such as the famous place de l'Etoile, place de la Nation and place du Panth\u00e9on), improving the traffic flow and, last but not least, the circulation of army troops. Haussmann also built modern housing with uniform building heights, new water supply and sewer systems, new bridges, etc (see Fig. 1 where we show how dramatic the impact of Haussmann transformations are). The case of Paris under Haussmann provides an interesting example where changes due to central planning are very important and where a naive modelling is bound to fail. We analyze here in detail the effect of these planned transformations on the street network. By introducing physical quantitative measures associated with this network, we are able to compare the effect of the Hausmann transformation of the city with its \u2018natural\u2019 evolution over other periods.In Fig. 2(a), we display the map of Paris as it was in 1789 on top of the current map (2010). In order to use a single basis for comparison, we limited our study over time to the portion corresponding to 1789. We note here that the evolution of the outskirts and small villages in the surroundings has certainly an impact on the evolution of Paris and even if we focus here (mainly because of data availability reasons) on the structural modifications of the inner structure of Paris, a study at a larger scale will certainly be needed for capturing the whole picture of the evolution of this city. We then have 6 maps for different times and for the same area (of order 34\u2005km2). We also represent on Fig. 2(b), the new streets created during the Haussmann period which covers roughly the second half of the 19th century. Even if we observe some evolution outside of this portion, most of the Haussmann works are comprised within this portion.(a) Map of Paris in 1789 superimposed on the map of current 2010 Paris.In the whole study, we focus on the Haussmann modifications and limited ourselves to the 1789 portion of the street network. (b) Map of Haussmann modifications. The grey lines represent the road network in 1836, the green lines represent the Haussmann modifications which are basically all contained in the 1789 area (figure created from authors' data with ArcGiS 10.0 (ESRI): www.esri.com/software/arcgis/).We can have three different types of new links depending on the number of new nodes they connect. We denote by Ei (i = 1, 2, 3) the number of new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting i new nodes. For example E0 counts the new links appearing at time t + 1 connecting two nodes existing at time t. In order to categorize more precisely these new links, we use the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4 defined in23 and which measures how a new link (absent at time t and present at time t + 1) affects the average betweenness centrality (see Methods section for definitions of the betweenness centrality impact \u03b4). In23, the distribution of this quantity displays two peaks which corresponds to two types of links belonging to two distinct processes: densification and exploration23. We first observe (see Figure 2 of SI) that in the first period, the majority of new links are of the E2 type and correspond to construction of new streets with new nodes. We see that the Haussmann transition period (1836\u20131888) is not particularly different from the other previous periods. In the modern period (after 1999), E0 becomes dominant and consistent with the idea of a mature street network where densification dominates the evolution of the urban tissue. Obviously, this is also an effect of limiting ourselves to the 1789 portion: in a wider area, many new roads were created and both densification and exploration coexist. We note here that the structure of the street network of central Paris remained remarkably stable from 1888 until now (and in this period also, densification was the main process in this area).This figure shows that densification is the main process for this portion of Paris and that from this point of view, the Haussmann period seems to be rather smooth and comparable to other periods.The betweenness centrality (BC) gv(i) of a node i is defined in the Methods section and essentially measures the fraction of times a given node is used in the shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network, and is thus a measure of the contribution of a link in the organisation of flows in the network26. In our case where we consider a limited portion of a spatial network, two important effects need to be taken into consideration. First, as we consider a portion, only paths within this portion are taken into account in the calculation of the BC and this usually does not reflect the reality of the actual origin-destination matrix. In particular, flows with the exterior of the portion and surrounding villages are not taken into account. As a result, the BC will be able to detect important routes and nodes in the internal structure of the network but will miss large-scale communication roads such as a north-south or a East-West road connecting the portion with the surroundings of Paris. In23, the scale of the network was large enough so that the BC could recover important central roads such as Roman streets. The BC in the present case has then to be used as a structural probe of the network, enabling us to track the important modifications. The second point concerns the spatial distribution of the BC which will be important in the following. For a lattice the most central nodes (see the discussion in22 for example) are close to the barycenter of the nodes: spatial centrality and betweenness centrality are then usually strongly correlated. In16 and17 it is shown that the most central points display interesting spatial structures which still need to be understood, but which represent an important signature of the networks' topology.So far, most of the measures indicate that the evolution of the street network follows simple densification and exploration rules and is very similar to other areas studied23. At this point, it appears that Haussmann works didn't change radically the structure of the city. However, we can suspect that Haussmann's impact is very important on congestion and traffic and should therefore be seen on the spatial distribution of centrality. In the figure 5, we show the maps of Paris at different times and we indicate the most central nodes (such that their centrality gv(i) is larger than max gv/\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 10 see the SI, for a discussion on the effect of the value of \u03b1). We can clearly see here that the spatial distribution of the BC is not stable, displays large variations, and is not uniformly distributed over the Paris area (we represented here the node centrality, and similar results are obtained for the edge centrality, see the SI for plots for the edge centrality and more details). In particular, we see that between 1836 and 1888, the Haussmann works had a dramatical impact on the spatial structure of the centrality, especially near the heart of Paris. Central roads usually persist in time23,27, but in our case, the Haussmann reorganization was acting precisely at this level by redistributing the shortest paths which had certainly an impact on congestion inside the city. After Haussmann we observe a large stability of the network until nowadays.It is interesting to note that these maps also provide details about the evolution of the road network of Paris during other periods which seems to reflect what happened in reality and which we can relate to specific local interventions. For example, in the period 1789\u20131826 between the French Revolution and the Napoleonic empire, the maps shown in Fig. 5 display large variations with redistribution of central nodes which probably reflects the fact that many religious and aristocratic domains and properties were sold and divided in order to create new houses and new roads, improving congestion inside Paris. During the period 1826\u20131836 which corresponds roughly to the beginning of the the July Monarchy, the maps in Fig. 5 suggests an important reorganization on the east side of Paris. This seems to correspond very well to the creation during that period of a new channel in this area (the channel \u2018Saint Martin\u2019) which triggered many transformations in the eastern part of the network.In order to analyse the spatial redistribution effect more quantitatively, we compute various quantities inside a disk of radius r centered on the barycenter of all nodes (which stays approximately at the same location in time). We first study the number of nodes N(r) (Fig. 6), its variation \u03b4N(r) between t and t + 1, and the number of central nodes (such that gv(i) > max gv/10). We see that the largest variation of the number of nodes (see Fig. 6b) is indeed in the Haussmann period 1836\u20131888, especially for distance r > 1,500 meters. More interesting, is the variation of the most central nodes (Fig. 6d). In particular, we observe that during the pre-Haussmann period, even if in the period 1789\u20131826 there was an improvement of centrality concentration, there is an accumulation of central nodes both at short distances (r < 2,500 meters) and at long distances (r > 2,500 meters) in the following period (1826\u20131836). As a result, visually clear in Fig. 5, there is a large concentration of centrality in the center of Paris until 1836 at least. The natural consequence of this concentration is that the center of Paris was very probably very congested at that time. In this respect, what happens under the Haussmann supervision is natural as he acts on the spatial organization of centrality. We see indeed that in 1888, the most central nodes form a more reticulated structure excluding concentration of centrality. A structure which remained stable until now. Interestingly, we note that Haussmann's new roads and avenues represent approximately 6% of the total length only (compared to nowadays network), which is a small fraction, considered that it has a very important impact on the centrality spatial organization.As expected the largest variation occurred during the Haussmann period. Bottom panels: (c) Number of nodes at distance r and with centrality larger than g0 (g0 = max gv/10) and (d) its variation. The thick green line in the right panels indicate the Haussmann transition 1836\u20131888. We see here that during the Haussmann period (and also in the 1789\u20131826 period), there is a large decrease of the number of central nodes in the central region of Paris (r < 2,000 meters).In this paper, we have studied the evolution of the street network of the city of Paris. This case is particularly interesting as Paris experienced large modifications in the 19th century (the Haussmann period) allowing us to try to quantity the effect of central planning. Our results for central Paris reveal that most indicators follow a smooth evolution, dominated by a densification process, despite the important perturbation that happened during Haussmann. In our results, the important quantitative signature of central planning is the spatial reorganization of the most central nodes, in contrast with other regions where self-organization dominated and which didn't experience such a large-scale structure modification. This structural reorganization was obtained by the creation at a large scale of new roads and avenues (and the destruction of older roads) which do not follow the constraints of the existing geometry. These new roads do not follow the densification/exploration process but appear at various angles and intersect with many other existing roads.1789: Map of the city of Paris with its new enclosure.

On one hand, there are countries like France which appear to have a relatively monocentric structure based on Paris. This may be contrasted with the polycentric structure observed in western Germany, where there is no dominant city and several of the main urban centres are of a similar size.\nAcross the whole of Europe, the most populous cities were London (data are for 2011) and Istanbul (data are for 2000), they both recorded resident populations of more than 8.0\u00a0million persons. In 2012, the next largest cities across the EU included Paris (6.5 million) and Berlin (3.5 million), while Madrid, Barcelona, Milano and Napoli each reported 3.2 or 3.1 million inhabitants; this was also the case for Ankara in Turkey (data are for 2000).\nFigure\u00a01 shows an example of how the age structure of the population varies across European cities. It provides a comparison of the age structure for six EU Member States and compares this with similar information for each of their capital cities.\nThere were 103 cities in the EU that reported old-age dependency ratios of less than 20.0\u00a0% (as shown by the lightest shade). The lowest old-age dependency ratio in the EU was 9.2\u00a0% in Slatina (Romania), while two suburban areas close to Madrid \u2014 Fuenlabrada and Parla \u2014 had the second and third lowest rates (9.8\u00a0% and 10.6\u00a0%). This pattern of relatively low old-age dependency rates observed for suburban areas around the Spanish capital was repeated for the French capital, as Marne la Vall\u00e9e, Saint Denis, Cergy-Pontoise, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines and Evry were the only French towns and cities to record old-age dependency ratios below 15.0\u00a0% and they are all situated within a radius of no more than 20\u00a0km from central Paris. Several reasons may underlie this pattern: young people may be unable to afford to buy or rent in the centre of big cities and instead choose to live in the surrounding suburbs, families may choose to move to the suburbs to have more space, older people may move out of the suburbs.\nHigher proportion of the non-national population coming from outside of the EU in Berlin, Paris, Madrid and Wien\nThe information presented in Figure\u00a03 also provides a breakdown of the non-national population between those inhabitants that are from other EU Member States and those who come from non-member countries. Among those capital cities for which data are available, there were five which reported that at least 10.0\u00a0% of their population was composed of non-EU nationals; they were Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Wien and Bruxelles / Brussel (which had the highest share at 13.5\u00a0%). A majority of the population in Luxembourg was composed of EU nationals; Bruxelles / Brussel (20.3\u00a0%) and Luxembourg (54.4\u00a0%) were the only capital cities to report that at least 10.0\u00a0% of their population was composed of nationals from other EU Member States (which may, at least in part, be explained by both of these cities being home to various EU institutions).\nThe average number of persons per household was close to 3.0 persons across several cities in Spain, Portugal and France. There was also a relatively large dispersion in average household sizes between the different cities of these three countries, which was also the case for Italy. In Spain and in France, the largest households were most frequently recorded in suburban areas: for example, each of Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n, Majadahonda, Coslada and Fuenlabrada (around Madrid) and CA Val de France (around Paris) recorded an average of at least 3.0 persons per household. By contrast, the lowest averages in France were often recorded in the centre of some of the biggest cities, for example, Paris (1.9 persons).\n", "", "EU-28 population density was estimated at 116.3 inhabitants per square kilometre (km\u00b2) in 2012. Map\u00a01 shows the diversity of NUTS\u00a03 regions across the EU: from the most densely populated areas, such as the capital cities of Paris (21\u00a0516 inhabitants per km\u00b2 in 2012) and London (10\u00a0374 and 9\u00a0311 in 2010 for Inner London - West and Inner London - East), to remote, sparsely inhabited areas, such as those of northern Scandinavia, for example, the Swedish region of Norrbottens l\u00e4n had the largest total area of all NUTS\u00a03 regions (105\u00a0205 km\u00b2) and the second lowest population density (2.6 inhabitants per km\u00b2). For comparison, the total area covered by Norrbottens l\u00e4n was almost 1\u00a0000 times as large as the area covered by Paris (105.4 km\u00b2).\nAside from Paris and the two Inner London regions, the most densely populated regions in the EU-28 \u2014 with above 5\u00a0000 inhabitants per km\u00b2 \u2014 included: the suburban regions surrounding Paris (Hauts-de Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne); Bucuresti, the capital of Romania (data are for 2011); the Arrondissement de Bruxelles-Capitale/Arrondissement van Brussel-Hoofdstad, the capital of Belgium; the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla; and Portsmouth on the southern coast of the United Kingdom (data are for 2010).\nThere were almost 11\u00a0000 times as many persons living on each square kilometre of land in Paris as there were in Lappi (in the north of Finland)\nThe least densely populated regions in the EU were generally located around the periphery in remote environments. Lappi (the most northerly region of Finland) had the lowest regional population density among NUTS\u00a03 regions in the EU, at 2.0 inhabitants per km\u00b2 in 2012. As such, there were almost 11\u00a0000 times as many persons living on each square kilometre of land in Paris as there were in Lappi. There were 13 other NUTS\u00a03 regions that reported population density below 10.0 inhabitants per km\u00b2: four of these were in central and northern Sweden (Norrbottens l\u00e4n; J\u00e4mtlands l\u00e4n; V\u00e4sterbottens l\u00e4n; and Dalarnas l\u00e4n); three were in the north-west of Scotland (Lochaber, Skye and Lochalsh, Arran and Cumbrae, and Argyll and Bute; Caithness and Sutherland, and Ross and Cromarty; Eilean Siar (Western Isles) \u2014 data are for 2010); two more were in Finland (Kainuu and Pohjois-Karjala); two in central Spain (Soria and Teruel); while there was also a single region from each of France (the overseas region of Guyane) and Croatia (the rural, quite mountainous region of Li\u010dko-senjska \u017eupanija to the north of Zadar).\nFigure\u00a01 presents information on the 10 NUTS\u00a03 regions in the EU with the highest shares of younger persons (aged less than 15) and the 10 NUTS\u00a03 regions in the EU with the highest shares of elderly persons (aged 65 and above) in their respective populations as of the start of 2013. Those NUTS\u00a03 regions in the EU with the highest shares of young persons were generally located in those Member States which recorded the highest birth and fertility rates (see Map\u00a05 and Figure\u00a04), thereby boosting the relative importance of younger persons in the total population. This was particularly the case in several Irish and French regions, for example, the overseas regions of Guyane and R\u00e9union or suburban regions around Paris. Age structures of largely urban areas may display a higher proportion of young and working-age persons as a result of a \u2018pull effect\u2019 associated with increased employment opportunities attracting both internal migrants (from different regions of the same country) and international migrants (from other Member States and non-member countries).\nOn the basis of a comparison for the EU-28 Member States, the population increased each and every year between 1\u00a0January 1960 and 1\u00a0January 2013, with overall growth of 98.9 million inhabitants, equivalent to an annualised growth rate of 0.4\u00a0%. Historically, population growth in the EU has largely reflected developments in natural population change (the total number of births minus the total number of deaths), as opposed to migratory patterns. A closer examination shows that natural population growth for an aggregate composed of the EU-28 Member States peaked in 1964, when 3.6 million more births than deaths were recorded. Birth rates progressively fell and life expectancy gradually increased, resulting in a slowdown of the natural rate of population growth. By 2003, natural population growth for the EU-28 Member States was almost balanced, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by less than 100\u00a0000. Subsequently, the birth rate and natural population growth increased again somewhat in several Member States, although this pattern was generally reversed with the onset of the financial and economic crisis.\nOn the basis of a comparison between 2009 and 2012, crude birth rates fell in most EU Member States \u2014 suggesting that the financial and economic crisis impacted upon the decision to have children. Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom were the only Member States to report an increase in their crude birth rates from 2009 to 2012 (in the case of Germany and Austria from very low starting rates), while birth rates remained unchanged in Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia. Demographic and family policy experts are divided over the reasons for this apparent reluctance to have children; however according to the latest Eurostat population projections there will probably be a reduction in population numbers in the coming decades, with Germany, Spain and the Baltic Member States among the affected Member States.\nThe population data presented in this article are those available as of March 2014. For most of the countries, the population data for the year 2011 and after take into account the results of the latest population census (held in 2011). The time series of populations between the previous census taking place in these countries and 2011 will be revised by end-2014 by some countries, taking into account Eurostat recommendations. The comparison of populations between a pre-census and a post-census year (see breaks in series in the online database) may result in differences partially explained by changes in population structure and partially explained by the lack of revisions to pre-census population data at the time of writing of this article.\n", "D\u00e9partement de Paris (75)", "", "", "D\u00e9partement de Paris (75)", "", "", "", "Pour discuter au fur et \u00e0 mesure de leur lecture.

WIRED speaks to Station F director Roxanne Varza.Where to start?! Station F is the biggest startup campus in the world, based in Paris. The building is a 34,000m2 historical monument from the 1920s that has been converted into a massive startup space - it's literally the size of the Eiffel tower lying down. We consider ourselves a startup campus because we will have an entire ecosystem on-site with startups, investors, public services, various startup programmes and more. We're also launching a housing extension next year for 600 entrepreneurs to live ten minutes away. So it's in many ways like a university campus - but for startups.The idea from Station F came about in 2013. Xavier Niel \u2013 who is the man behind the project - noticed that the French ecosystem had a lot of great startups, startup programmes, investors, etc. but all very small and dispersed. People would compare Paris with London or Berlin. They would see Silicon Roundabout and Google Campus in London, they would see the Factory in Berlin. The idea was therefore to create a big emblematic space to bring the ecosystem together and provide services and space, especially to young startups that often struggle to find space and resources within their budget.After the Brexit referendum and with a renewed American isolationism, do you think Paris can provide a different kind of hub for global startups? Is Station F part of a strategy to attract talent that no longer feels welcomed in London and in America? Definitely \u2013 and we've actually had a lot of startups contact us telling us that Brexit, Donald Trump and high Silicon Valley prices are what encouraged them to look at Paris and Station F. That said, there isn't a specific strategy to attract startups as a result of Brexit, Donald Trump or whathaveyou.

La cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame et la Sainte-Chapelle sont des chefs-d'\u0153uvre d'architecture. Quant aux larges places et avenues construites par Haussmann, elles ont influenc\u00e9 l'urbanisme de la fin du XIXe et du XXe si\u00e8cle dans le monde entier.Vanaf de rivier de Seine kan men de ontwikkeling van Parijs en haar geschiedenis zien; van het Louvre tot de Eiffeltoren en van de Place de la Concorde tot het Grand en Petit Palais. De kathedraal van Notre-Dame en de Sainte Chapelle zijn architectonische meesterwerken, terwijl de grote pleinen en boulevards van Haussmann de stedenbouw aan het einde van de 19e en 20e eeuw over de hele wereld be\u00efnvloed hebben. Parijs is een rivierstad, al sinds de eerste menselijke nederzettingen \u2013 van de prehistorische dagen en het dorp van de Parisii stammen \u2013 heeft de Seine zowel een defensieve als een economische rol gespeeld.The banks of the Seine are studded with a succession of masterpieces, including, in particular, Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle, Louvre, Palais de l'lnstitut, Les Invalides, Place de la Concorde, \u00c9cole Militaire, La Monnaie (Mint), Grand Palais des Champs Elys\u00e9es, Eiffel Tower and Palais de Chaillot. A number of them, such as Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle, were definitive references in the spread of Gothic construction, while the Place de la Concorde or the vista at the Invalides exerted influence on the urban development of European capitals. The Marais and \u00cele Saint-Louis have coherent architectural ensembles, with highly significant examples of Parisian construction of the 17th and 18th centuries (H\u00f4tel Lauzun and H\u00f4tel Lambert on the \u00cele St Louis), Quai Malaquais, and Quai Voltaire.From the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower, from the Place de la Concorde to the Grand and Petit Palais, the evolution of Paris and its history can be seen from the River Seine. The Cathedral of Notre-Dame and the Sainte Chapelle are architectural masterpieces while Haussmann's wide squares and boulevards influenced late 19th- and 20th-century town planning the world over.Paris is a river town. Ever since the first human settlements, from the prehistoric days and the village of the Parisii tribes, the Seine has played both a defensive and an economic role. The present historic city, which developed between the 16th (and particularly the 17th) centuries and the 20th century, translates the evolution of the relationship between the river and the people: defence, trade, promenades, etc.The choice of the zone between Pont de Sully and Pont d'l\u00e9na is based on the age-old distinction between Paris upstream and Paris downstream. Upstream, beyond the Ars\u00e9nal, begins Paris the port and river transport town; downstream is the royal and subsequently aristocratic Paris, which had only limited commercial activity. It is this latter section of the city which was selected for the World Heritage List.

In the works of Man Ray (2005.100.141) and Maurice Tabard (1987.1100.141), the use of such procedures as double exposure, combination printing, montage, and solarization dramatically evoked the union of dream and reality. Other photographers used techniques such as rotation (1987.1100.49) or distortion (1987.1100.321) to render their images uncanny. Hans Bellmer (1987.1100.15) obsessively photographed the mechanical dolls he fabricated himself, creating strangely sexualized images, while the painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte (1987.1100.157) used the camera to create photographic equivalents of his paintings.

Dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, this \"Bible in stone\" has served as a silent witness to the tumultuous history of France. The cathedral stands on the eastern end of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 on the banks of the River Seine.On this spot in 1160, the Bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, drew on the ground with his crozier the outlines of what was to become one of the most famous Gothic cathedrals. Bishop de Sully was to devote the rest of his life and all his personal fortune to building the monumental church. Money to pay for covering the roof with lead was conveyed in his will.In 1163, accompanied by Bishop de Sully, King Louis VII, and all the clergy and nobles of Paris, Pope Alexander III consecrated the new Cathedral under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary. For the next 200 years the church saw workers from many generations laboring to complete this sublime edifice.Historians often blame the French Revolution for the damage that necessitated later restoration projects. Yet Hugo also criticized what Parisians of the 18th century had done to the great cathedral in the name of fashion rather than revolution.Even so, looking to Notre Dame de Paris, we understand that there is hope. Despite the traces of destruction imprinted on this ancient church, Our Lady at Paris is still a majestic and sublime edifice.", "\n      About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his\n      curacy\u2014just what, is not precisely known\u2014took him to Paris.\n      Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his\n      parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had come\n      to visit his uncle, the worthy Cur\u00e9, who was waiting in the anteroom,\n      found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding\n      himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round\n      and said abruptly:\u2014\n    \n      The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the\n      beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the\n      Faculty of Paris, Abb\u00e9 of Simore, who had been Bishop of D\u2014\u2014\n      in 1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about\n      it had a grand air,\u2014the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,\n      the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks\n      encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens\n      planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb\n      gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens,\n      M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords\n      Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de\n      Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand\n      Prior of France, Abb\u00e9 of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de\n      Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop,\n      Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in\n      ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these\n      seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable\n      date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a\n      table of white marble.\n    \n      Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might be\n      which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound\n      meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of\n      the volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with the\n      book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written by him\n      on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with\n      Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American station.\n      Versailles, Poincot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai des\n      Augustins.\n    \n      The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor,\n      and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers on\n      the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a garden, a quarter of\n      an acre in extent. The two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop was\n      lodged below. The first room, opening on the street, served him as\n      dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory. There\n      was no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through the\n      bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. At\n      the end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a\n      bed, for use in cases of hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to\n      country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes\n      brought to D\u2014\u2014\n    \n      They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the\n      magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to\n      clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\n    \n      Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperor\n      had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops.\n      The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the\n      5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by\n      Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at\n      Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first time\n      on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M.\n      Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it. But he was\n      present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences.\n      Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close to nature, in rusticity\n      and deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these eminent\n      personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly. He very\n      soon returned to D\u2014\u2014 He was interrogated as to this speedy\n      return, and he replied: \"I embarrassed them. The outside air penetrated to\n      them through me. I produced on them the effect of an open door.\"\n    \n      Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a\n      general, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency.\n      He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command in\n      Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had put\n      himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor as\n      though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to\n      escape. His correspondence with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine,\n      worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more\n      affectionate.\n    \n      Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church.\n      These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed,\n      skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who\n      know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese\n      dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links between the\n      sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests, prelates rather\n      than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being persons of influence,\n      they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and\n      upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of large\n      parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, and cathedral posts,\n      while awaiting episcopal honors. As they advance themselves, they cause\n      their satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system on the\n      march. Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite. Their\n      prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions.\n      The larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the\n      favorite. And then, there is Rome. A bishop who understands how to become\n      an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries\n      you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you\n      receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal\n      chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a\n      step, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of\n      a ballot. Every skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays\n      the only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king!\n      the supreme king. Then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary! How\n      many blushing choristers, how many youthful abbes bear on their heads\n      Perrette's pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call\n      itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee\n      that it is.\n    \n      Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the\n      big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young priests\n      about him. We have seen that he \"did not take\" in Paris. Not a single\n      future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man. Not a single\n      sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his\n      shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like\n      himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a\n      cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that\n      they were finished and he was completed. The impossibility of growing\n      great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner\n      had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got\n      themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off\n      in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. A\n      saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he\n      might communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an\n      anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short,\n      more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided.\n      Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a\n      gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from\n      the slope of corruption.\n    \n      No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he?\n      From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance into\n      D\u2014\u2014 by the same street which, seven months previously, had\n      witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes to\n      Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very much\n      fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below\n      the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi,\n      and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. He\n      must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him\n      stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in\n      the market-place.\n    \n      One can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom were\n      over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;\n      Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her\n      brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806,\n      which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever\n      since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving\n      utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly\n      suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and\n      Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a white\n      quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the\n      only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white\n      fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large,\n      short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted\n      round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached\n      by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow\n      stockings, like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle Baptistine's gown\n      was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow, sheath-like\n      skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealed her gray hair\n      under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. Madame Magloire had an\n      intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners of her mouth\n      unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger than the lower,\n      imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look. So long as\n      Monseigneur held his peace, she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of\n      respect and freedom; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have\n      seen, she obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did\n      not even speak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had\n      never been pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent\n      eyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person,\n      breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning. She\n      had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity, hope, those\n      three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that\n      gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made her\n      an angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished!\n    \n      \"The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink that\n      good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says that\n      wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that easy\n      gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his words with\n      graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that comfortable\n      trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand, without\n      advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge.\n      One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, neither\n      during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter a\n      single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he\n      entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother\n      was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a little\n      sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the\n      passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else who\n      had this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his\n      soul as well as his body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned\n      with moralizing and advice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortation\n      to conduct himself better in the future. My brother did not even ask him\n      from what country he came, nor what was his history. For in his history\n      there is a fault, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could\n      remind him of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when\n      my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a\n      gentle labor near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are\n      innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have\n      escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I\n      think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart. He was\n      thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his\n      misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was\n      to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that\n      he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way.\n      Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame,\n      something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon,\n      from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man\n      has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that this\n      might have been my brother's private thought. In any case, what I can say\n      is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from\n      beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and\n      he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same manner\n      in which he would have supped with M. Gedeon le Provost, or with the\n      curate of the parish.\n    \n      On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the\n      general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory\n      to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floreal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte,\n      was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves was\n      put in chains at Bic\u00eatre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang. An old\n      turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still recalls\n      perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth\n      line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on the ground\n      like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position, except that\n      it was horrible. It is probable that he, also, was disentangling from amid\n      the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of everything, something\n      excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his\n      head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears stifled him,\n      they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, \"I was\n      a tree-pruner at Faverolles.\" Then still sobbing, he raised his right hand\n      and lowered it gradually seven times, as though he were touching in\n      succession seven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was\n      divined that the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done for\n      the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children.\n    \n      It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures of\n      God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge, wandered\n      away at random,\u2014who even knows?\u2014each in his own direction\n      perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which\n      engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in\n      succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race.\n      They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village\n      forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them;\n      after a few years' residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot\n      them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. That\n      is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, did he\n      hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards the end of the\n      fourth year of his captivity. I know not through what channels the news\n      reached him. Some one who had known them in their own country had seen his\n      sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a poor street Rear Saint-Sulpice,\n      in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her only one child, a little boy, the\n      youngest. Where were the other six? Perhaps she did not know herself.\n      Every morning she went to a printing office, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she\n      was a folder and stitcher. She was obliged to be there at six o'clock in\n      the morning\u2014long before daylight in winter. In the same building\n      with the printing office there was a school, and to this school she took\n      her little boy, who was seven years old. But as she entered the printing\n      office at six, and the school only opened at seven, the child had to wait\n      in the courtyard, for the school to open, for an hour\u2014one hour of a\n      winter night in the open air! They would not allow the child to come into\n      the printing office, because he was in the way, they said. When the\n      workmen passed in the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated\n      on the pavement, overcome with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the\n      shadow, crouched down and doubled up over his basket. When it rained, an\n      old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her den,\n      where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and the\n      little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the cat that\n      he might suffer less from cold. At seven o'clock the school opened, and he\n      entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.\n    \n      One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical\n      strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the\n      galleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean\n      Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormous\n      weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced that\n      implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called orgueil\n      [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the Rue\n      Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had\n      nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing the\n      balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids of\n      Puget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point of\n      falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid with his\n      shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.\n    \n      1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance which\n      was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is\n      the year in which M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated. All the\n      hairdressers' shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird,\n      were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candid\n      time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the\n      church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, in his costume of a peer of\n      France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile\n      peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliant\n      action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the\n      12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly to\n      M. the Duke d'Angoul\u00eame. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up\n      little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of morocco\n      leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army was\n      dressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were\n      called legions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments;\n      Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he\n      was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle\n      Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had\n      succeeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was\n      a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand,\n      then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de\n      Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abb\u00e9 Louis, appointed minister of\n      finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two\n      augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass\n      of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop,\n      Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys\n      of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have been\n      seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces\n      of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were the\n      columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor's platform in the\n      Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the\n      bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these\n      columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large\n      hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point:\n      that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March\n      (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet\n      and the snuff-box a la Charter. The most recent Parisian sensation was the\n      crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother's head into the fountain of\n      the Flower-Market.\n    \n      They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of the\n      lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destined to\n      cover Chaumareix with infamy and Gericault with glory. Colonel Selves was\n      going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, in the Rue\n      de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform of the\n      octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards, which\n      had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis\n      XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to three or four\n      friends her unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue\n      satin. The N's were scratched off the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had\n      abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of the King's Garden [du Jardin du\n      Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the\n      Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied while\n      annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have\n      become emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had\n      two anxieties,\u2014Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy had\n      given for its prize subject, The Happiness procured through Study. M.\n      Bellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be seen germinating\n      that future advocate-general of Broe, dedicated to the sarcasms of\n      Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in\n      the interim, until there should be a false Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt.\n      Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was\n      proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The Institute had the\n      academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its list of members. A\n      royal ordinance erected Angoul\u00eame into a naval school; for the Duc\n      d'Angoul\u00eame, being lord high admiral, it was evident that the city of\n      Angoul\u00eame had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical\n      principle would have received a wound. In the Council of Ministers the\n      question was agitated whether vignettes representing slack-rope\n      performances, which adorned Franconi's advertising posters, and which\n      attracted throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paer, the\n      author of Agnese, a good sort of fellow, with a square face and a wart on\n      his cheek, directed the little private concerts of the Marquise de\n      Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Eveque. All the young girls were singing the\n      Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words by Edmond Geraud. The Yellow Dwarf was\n      transferred into Mirror. The Cafe Lemblin stood up for the Emperor,\n      against the Cafe Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de Berri,\n      already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a\n      princess of Sicily. Madame de Stael had died a year previously. The\n      body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers were all very\n      small. Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The\n      Constitutionnel was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand\n      Chateaubriant. That t made the good middle-class people laugh heartily at\n      the expense of the great writer. In journals which sold themselves,\n      prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815. David had no longer\n      any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest,\n      Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no longer any\n      genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile by\n      post very rarely reached him, as the police made it their religious duty\n      to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes complained of it in his\n      exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian publication, shown some displeasure\n      at not receiving letters which had been written to him, it struck the\n      royalist journals as amusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on\n      this occasion. What separated two men more than an abyss was to say, the\n      regicides, or to say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies;\n      to say Napoleon, or to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed\n      that the era of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII.,\n      surnamed \"The Immortal Author of the Charter.\" On the platform of the\n      Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the\n      statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the\n      rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders\n      of the Right said at grave conjunctures, \"We must write to Bacot.\" MM.\n      Canuel, O'Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to some\n      extent with Monsieur's approval, of what was to become later on \"The\n      Conspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau\"\u2014of the waterside. L'Epingle Noire\n      was already plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring with\n      Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand\n      stood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in\n      footed trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his\n      gray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist's\n      instruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were\n      charming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M.\n      Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone,\n      preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann\n      signed himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Therese Aubert. Divorce was\n      abolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decorated\n      on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos of the\n      King of Rome. The counter-police of the chateau had denounced to her Royal\n      Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc\n      d'Orleans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of a\n      colonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of\n      colonel-general of dragoons\u2014a serious inconvenience. The city of\n      Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense.\n      Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or\n      such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M.\n      Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedian\n      Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Moliere had not\n      been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Odeon, upon whose\n      pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE EMPRESS\n      to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet de Montarlot.\n      Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal, Pelicier,\n      published an edition of Voltaire, with the following title: Works of\n      Voltaire, of the French Academy. \"That will attract purchasers,\" said the\n      ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be\n      the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him\u2014a sign\n      of glory; and this verse was composed on him:\u2014\n    \n      As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie,\n      administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappes\n      was begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain,\n      afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his sublime\n      dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science, whom\n      posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier, whom the\n      future will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark; a note to a\n      poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms: a certain Lord\n      Baron. David d'Angers was trying to work in marble. The Abb\u00e9 Caron was\n      speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering of seminarists in the\n      blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest, named Felicite-Robert,\n      who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thing which smoked and\n      clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dog went and came\n      beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont\n      Louis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was not good for much; a sort\n      of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia\u2014a\n      steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently at this useless thing. M. de\n      Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by a coup d'etat, the\n      distinguished author of numerous academicians, ordinances, and batches of\n      members, after having created them, could not succeed in becoming one\n      himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the pavilion de Marsan wished to\n      have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on account of his piety. Dupuytren\n      and Recamier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre of the School of\n      Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists on the subject of the\n      divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one eye on Genesis and the other on\n      nature, tried to please bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with texts\n      and by making mastodons flatter Moses.\n    \n      This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and is\n      now forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannot\n      do otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, these\n      details, which are wrongly called trivial,\u2014there are no trivial\n      facts in humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,\u2014are useful. It\n      is of the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries\n      is composed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged \"a fine\n      farce.\"\n    \n      These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the third\n      from Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; and\n      when one says student, one says Parisian: to study in Paris is to be born\n      in Paris.\n    \n      Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregs\n      of the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of\n      social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the\n      unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can say? She had\n      never known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She had\n      never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory still\n      existed. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; the\n      Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased the first random\n      passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very small child, running\n      bare-legged in the street. She received the name as she received the water\n      from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She was called little\n      Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature had entered life\n      in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and went to\n      service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came to\n      Paris \"to seek her fortune.\" Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as\n      long as she could. She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold\n      and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls\n      were in her mouth.\n    \n      It is hard nowadays to picture to one's self what a pleasure-trip of\n      students and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago. The\n      suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what may be\n      called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last\n      half-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car; where\n      there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak of\n      Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris of\n      1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.\n    \n      Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those rare\n      dreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront\n      everything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this little\n      working-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of the\n      ancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred. She\n      was beautiful in the two ways\u2014style and rhythm. Style is the form of\n      the ideal; rhythm is its movement.\n    \n      After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King's\n      Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes our\n      memory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was attracting all Paris\n      to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem, whose\n      numerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads, were\n      covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub the air of\n      a head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiring crowd\n      about it.\n    \n      Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even\n      decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the\n      large square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolving\n      on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeyman\n      printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Every thing was\n      radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security;\n      it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of Police\n      Angeles to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminated\n      with these lines:\u2014\n    \n      \"Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be feared\n      from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. The\n      populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are very\n      pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one of your\n      grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of\n      Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of this population\n      should have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of the\n      suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is not\n      dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble.\"\n    \n      Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform\n      itself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the\n      miracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised by\n      Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their eyes\n      it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva\n      Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on the public square in Corinth the\n      colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restoration\n      beheld the populace of Paris in too \"rose-colored\" a light; it is not so\n      much of \"an amiable rabble\" as it is thought. The Parisian is to the\n      Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundly\n      than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he, no one can\n      better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be trusted\n      nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there is\n      glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury.\n      Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you\n      will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon's stay and Danton's resource. Is it a\n      question of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears up\n      the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blouse\n      drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! he will make of the\n      first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hour\n      strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; this little man\n      will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, and his breath will become a\n      tempest, and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to\n      disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is, thanks to the suburban man of\n      Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; it\n      is his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see! As\n      long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole, he only overthrows\n      Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, and he will free the world.\n    \n      There was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this\n      century, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop was\n      kept by some people named Thenardier, husband and wife. It was situated in\n      Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against the\n      wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying\n      another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a\n      general, with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the rest of\n      the picture consisted of smoke, and probably represented a battle. Below\n      ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO (Au Sargent de\n      Waterloo).\n    \n      After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately\n      lost sight of Favourite, Zephine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the\n      side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have been\n      greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they had\n      been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing. Fantine\n      had remained alone. The father of her child gone,\u2014alas! such\n      ruptures are irrevocable,\u2014she found herself absolutely isolated,\n      minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her\n      liaison with Tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she had\n      neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to her. She had no\n      resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how to write;\n      in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name; she had a\n      public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes, then a second, then a\n      third. Tholomyes replied to none of them. Fantine heard the gossips say,\n      as they looked at her child: \"Who takes those children seriously! One only\n      shrugs one's shoulders over such children!\" Then she thought of Tholomyes,\n      who had shrugged his shoulders over his child, and who did not take that\n      innocent being seriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. But\n      what was she to do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committed\n      a fault, but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was\n      modesty and virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of\n      falling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage was\n      necessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm. The idea of returning\n      to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some one might\n      possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would be necessary to\n      conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the necessity of a\n      separation which would be more painful than the first one. Her heart\n      contracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the\n      fierce bravery of life. She had already valiantly renounced finery, had\n      dressed herself in linen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments,\n      all her ribbons, and all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which\n      was left to her, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, which\n      produced for her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only\n      about eighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring\n      morning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one who had\n      seen these two pass would have had pity on them. This woman had, in all\n      the world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all the world, no\n      one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this had tired her\n      chest, and she coughed a little.\n    \n      Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for the\n      sake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, in\n      what was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris, the\n      \"little suburban coach service,\" Fantine found herself at Montfermeil, in\n      the alley Boulanger.\n    \n      That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her work in\n      Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere, in\n      her own native parts; that she had left Paris that morning on foot; that,\n      as she was carrying her child, and felt fatigued, she had got into the\n      Villemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemomble she had come to\n      Montfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked a little, but not\n      much, because she was so young, and that she had been obliged to take her\n      up, and the jewel had fallen asleep.\n    \n      It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having\n      been Clelie, was no longer anything but Lodoiska, still noble, but ever\n      more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scuderi to Madame\n      Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthelemy-Hadot,\n      was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even\n      ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame Thenardier was just\n      intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them. In them\n      she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given her, when very\n      young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude towards her\n      husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of\n      the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, but, so far as\n      sentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and\n      \"in what concerns the sex,\" as he said in his jargon\u2014a downright,\n      unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he\n      was. Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion,\n      began to grow gray, when the Magaera began to be developed from the\n      Pamela, the female Thenardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who\n      had dabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with\n      impunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named Eponine; as\n      for the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I\n      know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she\n      owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.\n    \n      Thanks to the traveller's fifty-seven francs, Thenardier had been able to\n      avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month they\n      were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette's outfit to Paris, and\n      pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty francs. As soon as that sum was\n      spent, the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely\n      as a child whom they were caring for out of charity; and they treated her\n      accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the\n      cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier brats; that is to say,\n      in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left\u2014a little better\n      than the dog, a little worse than the cat. Moreover, the cat and the dog\n      were her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table,\n      from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.\n    \n      At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an\n      inspector. He had not seen Madeleine's beginnings. Javert owed the post\n      which he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary of\n      the Minister of State, Comte Angeles, then prefect of police at Paris.\n      When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer was\n      already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.\n    \n      Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine had\n      him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in\n      the factory building itself, and which was served by two sisters of\n      charity. On the following morning the old man found a thousand-franc\n      bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine's\n      writing: \"I purchase your horse and cart.\" The cart was broken, and the\n      horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee remained stiff. M.\n      Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his\n      priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the\n      Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.\n    \n      It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the\n      sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, no\n      one knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would have\n      liked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible!\n    \n      That evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the direction\n      of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.\n    \n      There is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular, a\n      class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs\n      with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand\n      francs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuter species:\n      impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, a little folly,\n      a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, and who think\n      themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, \"My fields, my peasants,\n      my woods\"; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are\n      persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that\n      they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of tobacco, play\n      billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence, live at\n      the cafe, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the bones under the\n      table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table; who stick at a\n      sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise women, wear out\n      their old boots, copy London through Paris, and Paris through the medium\n      of Pont-A-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work, serve no use, and do\n      no great harm.\n    \n      M. Felix Tholomyes, had he remained in his own province and never beheld\n      Paris, would have been one of these men.\n    \n      Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at that\n      moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent\n      emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of\n      the town spit in the mayor's face was a thing so monstrous that, in his\n      most daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to\n      believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought,\n      he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to what\n      this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I know\n      not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But when he beheld\n      that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and say, \"Set this woman\n      at liberty,\" he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement; thought and\n      word failed him equally; the sum total of possible astonishment had been\n      exceeded in his case. He remained mute.\n    \n      \"I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believe\n      that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant of the\n      fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But here; I\n      will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go to her.\n      You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake the care\n      of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if you do not\n      like. I will give all the money you require. You shall be honest and happy\n      once more. And listen! I declare to you that if all is as you say,\u2014and\n      I do not doubt it,\u2014you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in\n      the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.\"\n    \n      That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it\n      himself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the\n      superscription ran: To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le\n      Prefet of Police. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited\n      about, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter before\n      it was sent off, and who recognized Javert's handwriting on the cover,\n      thought that he was sending in his resignation.\n    \n      \"At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.\"\n    \n      \"The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it\n      convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental\n      prison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named\n      Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointed\n      turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had\n      Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: 'Eh! Why, I know that man! He\n      is a fagot!4\n      Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!' 'Jean Valjean!\n      who's Jean Valjean?' Champmathieu feigns astonishment. 'Don't play the\n      innocent dodge,' says Brevet. 'You are Jean Valjean! You have been in the\n      galleys of Toulon; it was twenty years ago; we were there together.'\n      Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand. The case is investigated.\n      The thing was well ventilated for me. This is what they discovered: This\n      Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various\n      localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long\n      time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is\n      said to have been a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a\n      laundress; but that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys\n      for theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles.\n      Another fact. This Valjean's Christian name was Jean, and his mother's\n      surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging\n      from the galleys, he should have taken his mother's name for the purpose\n      of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to\n      Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan\u2014he is called\n      Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformed\n      into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were made at\n      Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not known\n      where they have gone. You know that among those classes a family often\n      disappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. When such people are\n      not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the story dates\n      thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew Jean\n      Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two\n      convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and\n      Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys\n      and confronted with the pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he\n      is Jean Valjean for them as well as for Brevet. The same age,\u2014he is\n      fifty-four,\u2014the same height, the same air, the same man; in short,\n      it is he. It was precisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation\n      to the Prefecture in Paris. I was told that I had lost my reason, and that\n      Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. You can imagine\n      whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same Jean\n      Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for me;\n      Champmathieu is conducted to me\u2014\"\n    \n      Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpetue,\n      she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely traced\n      the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in which\n      he mingles as much freedom as servitude: \"They shall have for their\n      convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; for chapel\n      only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the town and\n      the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for gratings\n      only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.\" This ideal was realized in\n      the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never been young, and it\n      seemed as though she would never grow old. No one could have told Sister\n      Simplice's age. She was a person\u2014we dare not say a woman\u2014who\n      was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied. She was so\n      gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid than granite. She\n      touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine. There\n      was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary,\n      and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a\n      confessional or enchanted a drawing-room. This delicacy accommodated\n      itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh contact a continual\n      reminder of heaven and of God. Let us emphasize one detail. Never to have\n      lied, never to have said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference,\n      any single thing which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister\n      Simplice's distinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue. She was\n      almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity. The\n      Abb\u00e9 Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute\n      Massieu. However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor\n      the crack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, innocent\n      lie\u2014does such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. To\n      lie a little is not possible: he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is\n      the very face of the demon. Satan has two names; he is called Satan and\n      Lying. That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did. The\n      result was the whiteness which we have mentioned\u2014a whiteness which\n      covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. Her smile was white, her\n      glance was white. There was not a single spider's web, not a grain of\n      dust, on the glass window of that conscience. On entering the order of\n      Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special\n      choice. Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred to\n      allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been\n      born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse\u2014a lie which would\n      have saved her. This patron saint suited this soul.\n    \n      In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take the\n      little-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish\n      in which M. Madeleine resided. The cure was, it was said, a worthy,\n      respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine arrived in\n      front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the street, and this\n      person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the priest's house he\n      halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and retraced his steps to the\n      door of the parsonage, which had an iron knocker. He laid his hand quickly\n      on the knocker and lifted it; then he paused again and stopped short, as\n      though in thought, and after the lapse of a few seconds, instead of\n      allowing the knocker to fall abruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed\n      his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously.\n    \n      The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. \"Where the\n      devil could Monsieur le Maire be going?\" They held counsel together. \"He\n      is going to Paris,\" said the wife. \"I don't believe it,\" said the husband.\n    \n      He took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung in the\n      fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed\n      tradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might have\n      been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment, To\n      Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d'Artois, Paris. He drew from his secretary\n      a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and the passport of which\n      he had made use that same year when he went to the elections.\n    \n      The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;\n      midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall; he\n      counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the sounds of\n      the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that, a few days\n      previously, he had seen in an ironmonger's shop an ancient clock for sale,\n      upon which was written the name, Antoine-Albin de Romainville.\n    \n      The torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was\n      unchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused once more;\n      they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar\n      to despair. The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to his mind, with\n      the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past. He thought that\n      Romainville was a little grove near Paris, where young lovers go to pluck\n      lilacs in the month of April.\n    \n      These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something\n      distorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in the\n      distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled the\n      insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with but\n      little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled at a\n      very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o'clock\n      every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M. sur M. a\n      little before five o'clock in the morning.\n    \n      What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the\n      morning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields pass\n      by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the road,\n      vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the\n      soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more melancholy and\n      more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last\n      time? To travel is to be born and to die at every instant; perhaps, in the\n      vaguest region of his mind, he did make comparisons between the shifting\n      horizon and our human existence: all the things of life are perpetually\n      fleeing before us; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled; after a\n      dazzling moment, an eclipse; we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands\n      to grasp what is passing; each event is a turn in the road, and, all at\n      once, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure\n      door; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us halts, and we\n      see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.\n    \n      The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor\n      had set out that morning before six o'clock, in a little tilbury harnessed\n      to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone alone, without\n      even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken; that people said\n      he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that others asserted that\n      they had met him on the road to Paris. That when he went away he had been\n      very gentle, as usual, and that he had merely told the portress not to\n      expect him that night.\n    \n      \"He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go through\n      Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do you\n      remember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette,\n      Soon, soon? He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign a\n      letter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers; they cannot say\n      anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have been paid;\n      the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have\n      received their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk, sister!\n      I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ill at all any more; I am\n      going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it is nearly five\n      years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much attached one gets\n      to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will see! If you only\n      knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the first place, she will\n      have very beautiful hands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a\n      year old; like this! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old;\n      she is quite a young lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is really\n      Euphrasie. Stop! this morning I was looking at the dust on the\n      chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that I\n      should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is not to see one's\n      children for years! One ought to reflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how\n      good M. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; he had on his\n      cloak, at least? he will be here to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will be\n      a festival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on my\n      little cap that has lace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I took\n      that journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences go\n      very quickly! he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it from\n      here to Montfermeil?\"\n    \n      He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which\n      contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache,\n      mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no doubt, the\n      9th of June, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded to the commune\n      the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them. Any spectator\n      who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who had watched him, would\n      have imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck him as very curious, for\n      he did not take his eyes from it, and he read it two or three times. He\n      read it without paying any attention to it, and unconsciously. He was\n      thinking of Fantine and Cosette.\n    \n      The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that provincial\n      tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar, and which was\n      formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as at Romorantin or\n      at Montbrison, and which to-day, having become classic, is no longer\n      spoken except by the official orators of magistracy, to whom it is suited\n      on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic stride; a tongue in\n      which a husband is called a consort, and a woman a spouse; Paris, the\n      centre of art and civilization; the king, the monarch; Monseigneur the\n      Bishop, a sainted pontiff; the district-attorney, the eloquent interpreter\n      of public prosecution; the arguments, the accents which we have just\n      listened to; the age of Louis XIV., the grand age; a theatre, the temple\n      of Melpomene; the reigning family, the august blood of our kings; a\n      concert, a musical solemnity; the General Commandant of the province, the\n      illustrious warrior, who, etc.; the pupils in the seminary, these tender\n      levities; errors imputed to newspapers, the imposture which distills its\n      venom through the columns of those organs; etc. The lawyer had,\n      accordingly, begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apples,\u2014an\n      awkward matter couched in fine style; but Benigne Bossuet himself was\n      obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration, and he\n      extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion. The lawyer\n      established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been\n      circumstantially proved. His client, whom he, in his character of counsel,\n      persisted in calling Champmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor\n      breaking that branch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which\n      the lawyer preferred to call a bough) in his possession; but he said that\n      he had found it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.\n      Where was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had been\n      broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then thrown away\n      by the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that there had been a thief in\n      the case. But what proof was there that that thief had been Champmathieu?\n      One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. The lawyer did not deny\n      that that character appeared to be, unhappily, well attested; the accused\n      had resided at Faverolles; the accused had exercised the calling of a\n      tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu might well have had its origin\n      in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,\u2014in short, four witnesses\n      recognize Champmathieu, positively and without hesitation, as that\n      convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this testimony, the counsel\n      could oppose nothing but the denial of his client, the denial of an\n      interested party; but supposing that he was the convict Jean Valjean, did\n      that prove that he was the thief of the apples? that was a presumption at\n      the most, not a proof. The prisoner, it was true, and his counsel, \"in\n      good faith,\" was obliged to admit it, had adopted \"a bad system of\n      defence.\" He obstinately denied everything, the theft and his character of\n      convict. An admission upon this last point would certainly have been\n      better, and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges; the\n      counsel had advised him to do this; but the accused had obstinately\n      refused, thinking, no doubt, that he would save everything by admitting\n      nothing. It was an error; but ought not the paucity of this intelligence\n      to be taken into consideration? This man was visibly stupid.\n      Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside the\n      galleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himself badly; was that a\n      reason for condemning him? As for the affair with Little Gervais, the\n      counsel need not discuss it; it did not enter into the case. The lawyer\n      wound up by beseeching the jury and the court, if the identity of Jean\n      Valjean appeared to them to be evident, to apply to him the police\n      penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban, and\n      not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a\n      second offence.\n    \n      \"This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris, and\n      that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the wheelwright's\n      trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards, under sheds when\n      the masters are good, never in closed workshops, because space is\n      required, you see. In winter one gets so cold that one beats one's arms\n      together to warm one's self; but the masters don't like it; they say it\n      wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice between the paving-stones is\n      hard work. That wears a man out quickly One is old while he is still quite\n      young in that trade. At forty a man is done for. I was fifty-three. I was\n      in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean! When a man is no longer\n      young, they call him nothing but an old bird, old beast! I was not earning\n      more than thirty sous a day. They paid me as little as possible. The\n      masters took advantage of my age\u2014and then I had my daughter, who was\n      a laundress at the river. She earned a little also. It sufficed for us\n      two. She had trouble, also; all day long up to her waist in a tub, in\n      rain, in snow. When the wind cuts your face, when it freezes, it is all\n      the same; you must still wash. There are people who have not much linen,\n      and wait until late; if you do not wash, you lose your custom. The planks\n      are badly joined, and water drops on you from everywhere; you have your\n      petticoats all damp above and below. That penetrates. She has also worked\n      at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes through\n      faucets. You are not in the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front of\n      you, and rinse in a basin behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not so\n      cold; but there is that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins your\n      eyes. She came home at seven o'clock in the evening, and went to bed at\n      once, she was so tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have not\n      been very happy. She was a good girl, who did not go to the ball, and who\n      was very peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at\n      eight o'clock. There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah,\n      yes! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu\n      there? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. Go see at M. Baloup's; and after\n      all, I don't know what is wanted of me.\"\n    \n      An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly departing\n      from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean Valjean. It\n      has been established by the testimony of two or three carters who met him,\n      that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressed in a blouse. Where had\n      he obtained that blouse? No one ever found out. But an aged workman had\n      died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before, leaving behind him\n      nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the one.\n    \n      On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart at\n      the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwood\n      near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder\n      suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A young girl was\n      weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably of some outside\n      spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in the wind. At one\n      corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was\n      navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The wayfarer\n      struck into this.\n    \n      Napoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full speed to\n      Paris to announce that the battle was won.\n    \n      A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel\n      deployed before Lobau's corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussia\n      debouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and the\n      Prussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in\n      reserve behind Napoleon.\n    \n      Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon and\n      Wellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God, who\n      is fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a more extraordinary\n      comparison. On one side, precision, foresight, geometry, prudence, an\n      assured retreat, reserves spared, with an obstinate coolness, an\n      imperturbable method, strategy, which takes advantage of the ground,\n      tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions, carnage, executed\n      according to rule, war regulated, watch in hand, nothing voluntarily left\n      to chance, the ancient classic courage, absolute regularity; on the other,\n      intuition, divination, military oddity, superhuman instinct, a flaming\n      glance, an indescribable something which gazes like an eagle, and which\n      strikes like the lightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity,\n      all the mysteries of a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream,\n      the plain, the forest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced to\n      obey, the despot going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of\n      battle; faith in a star mingled with strategic science, elevating but\n      perturbing it. Wellington was the Bareme of war; Napoleon was its Michael\n      Angelo; and on this occasion, genius was vanquished by calculation. On\n      both sides some one was awaited. It was the exact calculator who\n      succeeded. Napoleon was waiting for Grouchy; he did not come. Wellington\n      expected Blucher; he came.\n    \n      If one places one's self at the culminating point of view of the question,\n      Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It is Europe\n      against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against Paris; it is\n      the statu quo against the initiative; it is the 14th of July, 1789,\n      attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the monarchies clearing\n      the decks in opposition to the indomitable French rioting. The final\n      extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty-six\n      years\u2014such was the dream. The solidarity of the Brunswicks, the\n      Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs with the\n      Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is true, that the\n      Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural reaction of\n      things, was forced to be liberal, and that a constitutional order was the\n      unwilling result of Waterloo, to the great regret of the conquerors. It is\n      because revolution cannot be really conquered, and that being providential\n      and absolutely fatal, it is always cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, in\n      Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones; after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII.\n      granting and conforming to the charter. Bonaparte places a postilion on\n      the throne of Naples, and a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, employing\n      inequality to demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen\n      countersigns the declaration of the rights of man. If you wish to gain an\n      idea of what revolution is, call it Progress; and if you wish to acquire\n      an idea of the nature of progress, call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils\n      its work irresistibly, and it is already fulfilling it to-day. It always\n      reaches its goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of Foy, who was\n      only a soldier, an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the\n      tribune. Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool\n      for that workman. It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its\n      divine work the man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old\n      tottering invalid of Father Elysee. It makes use of the gouty man as well\n      as of the conqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within.\n      Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the\n      sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be\n      continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the\n      turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has\n      pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.\n    \n      In short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; that which\n      smiled in Wellington's rear; that which brought him all the marshals'\n      staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of a marshal of France;\n      that which joyously trundled the barrows full of bones to erect the knoll\n      of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date\n      \"June 18, 1815\"; that which encouraged Blucher, as he put the flying army\n      to the sword; that which, from the heights of the plateau of\n      Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over its prey, was the\n      counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution which murmured that\n      infamous word \"dismemberment.\" On arriving in Paris, it beheld the crater\n      close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorched its feet, and it changed\n      its mind; it returned to the stammer of a charter.\n    \n      Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of July\n      effaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the\n      antithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was\n      white. The exile reigned. Hartwell's pine table took its place in front of\n      the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy were\n      mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day, Austerlitz\n      having become antiquated. The altar and the throne fraternized\n      majestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the health of society in\n      the nineteenth century was established over France, and over the\n      continent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon was celebrated.\n      The device non pluribus impar re-appeared on the stone rays representing a\n      sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d'Orsay. Where there had\n      been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. The Arc du Carrousel,\n      all laden with badly borne victories, thrown out of its element among\n      these novelties, a little ashamed, it may be, of Marengo and Arcola,\n      extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the Duc\n      d'Angoul\u00eame. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper's grave in\n      1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since the bones of Louis XVI.\n      and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.\n    \n      The second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an extract\n      from the Journal de Paris, of the same date. A former convict, who had\n      been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just appeared before the Court of\n      Assizes of the Var, under circumstances calculated to attract attention.\n      This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police, he had\n      changed his name, and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of\n      one of our small northern towns; in this town he had established a\n      considerable commerce. He has at last been unmasked and arrested, thanks\n      to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor. He had for his\n      concubine a woman of the town, who died of a shock at the moment of his\n      arrest. This scoundrel, who is endowed with Herculean strength, found\n      means to escape; but three or four days after his flight the police laid\n      their hands on him once more, in Paris itself, at the very moment when he\n      was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital\n      and the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have\n      profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty, to withdraw a\n      considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This\n      sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the\n      indictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to\n      himself alone, and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However\n      that may be, the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the\n      Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused of highway robbery\n      accompanied with violence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of\n      those honest children who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in\n      immortal verse,\n    \n      There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,\n      which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a popular\n      superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. We are\n      among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant.\n      Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil: it is thought that the\n      devil, from time immemorial, has selected the forest as a hiding-place for\n      his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at\n      nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a\n      carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a\n      blouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap or\n      hat, he has two immense horns on his head. This ought, in fact, to render\n      him recognizable. This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. There\n      are three ways of profiting by such an encounter. The first is to approach\n      the man and speak to him. Then it is seen that the man is simply a\n      peasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall; that he is not\n      digging any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that\n      what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is\n      carrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of\n      evening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dies\n      within the week. The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug\n      his hole, until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great\n      speed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the \"treasure\"\n      which the black man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies\n      within the month. Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black\n      man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs. One\n      then dies within the year.\n    \n      Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense\n      feebleness it affords men food for thought, Hence in the ports curious\n      people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation,\n      without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why. Every day,\n      accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and the jetties\n      of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and\n      loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring at the\n      Orion.\n    \n      Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. The\n      beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow nor\n      frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permission\n      of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village,\n      and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the same tolerance,\n      had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, and even extended them\n      into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will perhaps remember, the\n      Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. These people filled the inns and\n      drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisy\n      and joyous life. In order to play the part of a faithful historian, we\n      ought even to add that, among the curiosities displayed in the square,\n      there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad in rags and coming\n      no one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one\n      of those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did not\n      possess until 1845, and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I\n      believe that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to\n      the order of the Apicides, and to the family of the vultures. Some good\n      old Bonapartist soldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see this\n      creature with great devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored\n      cockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.\n    \n      We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. This\n      rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming from\n      Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, being\n      comfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at Waterloo, the\n      reader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived that he\n      exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven\n      of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and,\n      apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardier belonged to\n      that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating about\n      the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and travelling like a\n      family man, with wife and children, in a rickety cart, in the rear of\n      troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching himself to the\n      victorious army. This campaign ended, and having, as he said, \"some\n      quibus,\" he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there.\n    \n      On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked for\n      rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de l'Hopital\n      in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, and he\n      seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest houses on that\n      dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.\n    \n      And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king\n      always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of\n      Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was\n      rapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop; as\n      he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly have\n      had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe, in the\n      midst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with gilding, with\n      great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered noisily along.\n      There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the rear angle on the\n      right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm,\n      and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered a l'oiseau royal, a proud, hard,\n      crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets with bullion\n      fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of\n      Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of the\n      Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king.\n      Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his\n      knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he\n      put on his hat and saluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and\n      they returned it in kind. When he appeared for the first time in the\n      Saint-Marceau quarter, the whole success which he produced is contained in\n      this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, \"That big\n      fellow yonder is the government.\"\n    \n      The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter,\n      and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as to this\n      detail. When, at two o'clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by a squadron\n      of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched on the\n      boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpetriere, he appeared\n      surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in this\n      cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an\n      enclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havre from spying him\n      out.\n    \n      \"Monsieur Thenardier, one does not require a passport to travel five\n      leagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, and\n      that is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not\n      know my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention is\n      that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I break\n      the thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit you? Yes\n      or no?\"\n    \n      Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who\n      had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a\n      little girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,\n      pass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of Livry.\n    \n      When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he\n      was not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a\n      vessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding\n      himself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and reached\n      the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack money, he\n      procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier\n      was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,\u2014a lucrative\n      specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking\n      to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality, pursued an obscure\n      and undulating itinerary. He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, near\n      Beausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, near\n      Briancon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,\u2014a\n      mole's track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace of\n      his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the\n      Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market\n      of Chavailles, and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La\n      Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.\n    \n      His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a\n      little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure a\n      lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will be\n      remembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made a\n      mysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which the\n      law had gathered an inkling.\n    \n      However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased the\n      obscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journals\n      which chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured and\n      almost at peace, as though he had really been dead.\n    \n      On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the claws\n      of the Thenardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at nightfall,\n      with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There he entered a\n      cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the Observatoire. There he\n      got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by the hand, and together they\n      directed their steps through the darkness,\u2014through the deserted\n      streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaciere, towards the Boulevard\n      de l'Hopital.\n    \n      Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of\n      the Salpetriere, and who had mounted to the Barriere d'Italie by way of\n      the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Paris\n      disappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it was\n      not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the city,\n      for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in them; it was\n      not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it, then? It was an\n      inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert place where there\n      was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a street of Paris;\n      more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day than a cemetery.\n    \n      Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and prick\n      slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there was in\n      Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the Chatelet\n      named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two names had been\n      forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers;\n      they made the most of it. A parody was immediately put in circulation in\n      the galleries of the court-house, in verses that limped a little:\u2014\n    \n      Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm\n      which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue de\n      la Barri\u00e8re des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved, planted\n      with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the season,\n      and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor of\n      copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.\n    \n      This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the road to\n      Bic\u00eatre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration,\n      prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their\n      execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that mysterious\n      assassination, called \"The assassination of the Fontainebleau barrier,\"\n      whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholy problem\n      which has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which has never been\n      unriddled. Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe,\n      where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in\n      the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the abominable\n      pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that expedient of the\n      philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and shameful Place\n      de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before\n      the death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to\n      uphold it with authority.\n    \n      Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere, the\n      ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the Jardin\n      des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or four times\n      each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which, in a\n      given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left; for there are\n      things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact; and just as it\n      is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of\n      houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage of\n      vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a new life are evident. In this\n      old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks, the pavement shows itself,\n      the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer, even where there are as\n      yet no pedestrians. One morning,\u2014a memorable morning in July, 1845,\u2014black\n      pots of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day it might be said that\n      civilization had arrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that Paris had\n      entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.\n    \n      Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and took\n      possession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions to Jean\n      Valjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? Was Madame Thenardier very\n      far away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. All at once she exclaimed, \"How\n      pretty it is here!\"\n    \n      The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself,\n      has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been transformed\n      since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion,\n      unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he loves Paris: Paris\n      is his mind's natal city. In consequence of demolitions and\n      reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore away\n      religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must be\n      permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is\n      possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says, \"In\n      such a street there stands such and such a house,\" neither street nor\n      house will any longer exist in that locality. Readers may verify the facts\n      if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is unacquainted\n      with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an\n      illusion which is precious to him. It is a delight to him to dream that\n      there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he\n      was in his own country, and that all has not vanished. So long as you go\n      and come in your native land, you imagine that those streets are a matter\n      of indifference to you; that those windows, those roofs, and those doors\n      are nothing to you; that those walls are strangers to you; that those\n      trees are merely the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which\n      you do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread\n      are merely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive\n      that the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors;\n      and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well beloved by\n      you; that you entered those houses which you never entered, every day, and\n      that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in\n      those pavements. All those places which you no longer behold, which you\n      may never behold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished,\n      take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of an\n      apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak, the\n      very form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as they are,\n      as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to no change:\n      for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of\n      your mother.\n    \n      The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between the\n      Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Rap\u00e9e, is one of those which recent\n      improvements have transformed from top to bottom,\u2014resulting in\n      disfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according to\n      others. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings have\n      been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas, circuses,\n      hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there; progress, as\n      the reader sees, with its antidote.\n    \n      Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all\n      compounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut les\n      Quatre-Nations, and the Opera-Comique Feydeau, the precise spot whither\n      Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit Picpus. The Porte\n      Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barriere des Sergents, the Porcherons,\n      la Galiote, les Celestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe, l'Arbre de\n      Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne\u2014these are the names of old Paris which\n      survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers over these relics\n      of the past.\n    \n      Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed it\n      soundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it. Rubbish\n      shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter was\n      disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day, it has\n      been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existing plan has\n      preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of\n      1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the\n      Rue du Platre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin, Rue Merciere, at the sign of\n      Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, as we have just mentioned, a Y of streets,\n      formed by the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two\n      branches, taking on the left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the\n      right the name of the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected\n      at the apex as by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue\n      Polonceau ended there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards\n      the Lenoir market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of\n      the Rue Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning\n      abruptly at a right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on\n      his right a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no\n      issue and was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.\n    \n      Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison\n      at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in the\n      incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheer\n      muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his\n      hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of the\n      stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need\n      be; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of\n      the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned to\n      death, made his escape twenty years ago.\n    \n      Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the\n      linden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formed\n      with the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity,\n      by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably intended to preserve\n      that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures\n      called the passers-by. This practice of filling up corners of the wall is\n      much in use in Paris.\n    \n      At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At nightfall\n      lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended and\n      descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side to\n      side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley over which this\n      rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box, the key\n      to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protected\n      by a metal case.\n    \n      Where was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of\n      sepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An edifice\n      full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with the\n      voice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that terrible\n      vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and then opening\n      the horrible gates of the tomb! And it actually was an edifice, a house,\n      which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream! He had to touch the\n      stones to convince himself that such was the fact.\n    \n      When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrested\n      him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. sur\n      M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris. Paris is\n      a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything disappears in this\n      belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No forest hides a man as\n      does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know this. They go to Paris as to\n      an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The police know it also, and it is\n      in Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. They sought the\n      ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on their\n      researches. Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in the\n      recapture of Jean Valjean. Javert's zeal and intelligence on that occasion\n      had been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under\n      Comte Angles. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert's\n      patron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of\n      Paris. There Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word\n      may seem strange for such services, honorable manners.\n    \n      Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted from\n      the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in Paris,\n      concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under peculiar\n      circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil. A little\n      girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who had been\n      intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had been\n      stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette, and was\n      the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in the hospital, it was\n      not known where or when.\n    \n      The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean Valjean\n      had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a respite of\n      three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature's child. He\n      recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris at the very\n      moment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil. Some signs had\n      made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his\n      entering that coach, and that he had already, on the previous day, made an\n      excursion to the neighborhood of that village, for he had not been seen in\n      the village itself. What had he been intending to do in that region of\n      Montfermeil? It could not even be surmised. Javert understood it now.\n      Fantine's daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going there in search of\n      her. And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! Who could that\n      stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead. Javert,\n      without saying anything to anybody, took the coach from the Pewter\n      Platter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.\n    \n      Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javert\n      returned to Paris.\n    \n      He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of March,\n      1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of\n      Saint-Medard and who had been surnamed \"the mendicant who gives alms.\"\n      This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knew\n      exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years, who knew\n      nothing about herself, save that she had come from Montfermeil.\n      Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert prick up\n      his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person had\n      given alms, added a few more details. This gentleman of property was very\n      shy,\u2014never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one,\n      except, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach\n      him. He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many\n      millions, being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert's curiosity\n      in a decided manner. In order to get a close look at this fantastic\n      gentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle's outfit for a day,\n      and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every\n      evening, whining orisons through his nose, and playing the spy under cover\n      of prayer.\n    \n      Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not mentioned\n      the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was his secret,\n      and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place, because the\n      slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert; next, because,\n      to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape and was reputed\n      dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among\n      malefactors of the most dangerous sort, was a magnificent success which\n      the old members of the Parisian police would assuredly not leave to a\n      new-comer like Javert, and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict;\n      and lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a taste for the\n      unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded successes which are talked of\n      long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off. He preferred to\n      elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the\n      last.\n    \n      It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at\n      its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests\n      denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, and\n      had rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual liberty\n      was a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a mistake; the\n      prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The reader can\n      imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced by twenty\n      newspapers, would have caused in Paris: \"Yesterday, an aged grandfather,\n      with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman, who was walking\n      with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and conducted to the agency\n      of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!\"\n    \n      Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of being\n      forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette and\n      himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child\u2014all\n      this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean's walk, and\n      impressed on his bearing such senility, that the police themselves,\n      incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake.\n      The impossibility of approaching too close, his costume of an emigre\n      preceptor, the declaration of Thenardier which made a grandfather of him,\n      and, finally, the belief in his death in prison, added still further to\n      the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert's mind.\n    \n      For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers;\n      but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a good,\n      honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some merry blade\n      deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian misdeeds,\n      some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to conceal his other\n      talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows, accomplices'\n      retreats in case of emergencies, in which he would, no doubt, take refuge.\n      All these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate\n      that he was not a simple and honest man. To arrest him too hastily would\n      be \"to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs.\" Where was the\n      inconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure that he would not escape.\n    \n      The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual\n      Adoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, who,\n      at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,\u2014one at\n      the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve. However, the\n      Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,\n      were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\n      cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve and at the Temple. There were\n      numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their costume. The\n      Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, and\n      the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the Rue\n      Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve wore a white one, and had, besides, on their\n      breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or\n      gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy\n      Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of the\n      Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two orders\n      perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of the\n      Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just as\n      there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the\n      mysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus Christ and\n      the Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless, widely\n      separated, and on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy, established\n      at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France, established by\n      Pierre de Berulle. The Oratory of France claimed the precedence, since\n      Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Berulle was a cardinal.\n    \n      They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby\n      fruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the\n      punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, they\n      sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an\n      inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech to a\n      letter which lies before me, a letter written five and twenty years ago by\n      an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de\u2014\u2014one of the most\n      elegant women in Paris. I quote literally: \"One hides one's pear or one's\n      apple as best one may. When one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed\n      before supper, one stuffs them under one's pillow and at night one eats\n      them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in the closet.\"\n      That was one of their greatest luxuries.\n    \n      Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object of\n      attention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made, while\n      waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of Paris. It\n      was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in\n      the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of the young recluses\n      could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he had a sweet and rather\n      shrill voice, which they had come to know and to distinguish. He had been\n      a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be very coquettish, that his\n      handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head, and\n      that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire, and that his black\n      cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world. He held a great place in\n      all these imaginations of sixteen years.\n    \n      All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names,\n      Droit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them are\n      very much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called Maugout Lane; the\n      Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Eglantiers, for God opened flowers\n      before man cut stones.\n    \n      As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines\n      of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who\n      depended on Citeaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very\n      ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the holy\n      sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, in two churches\n      in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Greve, a rare and\n      frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. the Prior\n      and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Pres ordered a solemn procession of\n      all his clergy, in which the Pope's Nuncio officiated. But this expiation\n      did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and\n      the Comtesse de Chateauvieux. This outrage committed on \"the most holy\n      sacrament of the altar,\" though but temporary, would not depart from these\n      holy souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a\n      \"Perpetual Adoration\" in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652,\n      the other in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de\n      Bar, called of the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of\n      founding, to this pious end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the\n      first permission for this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar\n      by M. de Metz, Abb\u00e9 of Saint-Germain, \"on condition that no woman could be\n      received unless she contributed three hundred livres income, which amounts\n      to six thousand livres, to the principal.\" After the Abb\u00e9 of\n      Saint-Germain, the king accorded letters-patent; and all the rest,\n      abbatial charter, and royal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber\n      of Accounts and the Parliament.\n    \n      Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the\n      Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris.\n      Their first convent was \"a new building\" in the Rue Cassette, out of the\n      contributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Chateauvieux.\n    \n      The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it\n      alarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In\n      1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed nuns,\n      none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred; fifteen\n      years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How many are\n      there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the circle of\n      choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In proportion as the\n      number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service of each becomes more\n      painful; the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would be\n      but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the heavy rule of\n      Saint-Benoit. The burden is implacable, and remains the same for the few\n      as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. At the period\n      when the author of this book still lived in Paris, two died. One was\n      twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. This latter can say, like\n      Julia Alpinula: \"Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres.\" It is in\n      consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the education of girls.\n    \n      A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, is a\n      college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very act of\n      asceticism, in the very heart of the city of '89 and of 1830 and of 1848,\n      Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinary times, in\n      order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish, one has only\n      to make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinary times.\n    \n      Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on his\n      scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to Paris.\n      Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this\n      cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,\u2014to remain\n      there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this convent was both\n      the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most dangerous, because,\n      as no men might enter there, if he were discovered, it was a flagrant\n      offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step intervening between the\n      convent and prison; the safest, because, if he could manage to get himself\n      accepted there and remain there, who would ever seek him in such a place?\n      To dwell in an impossible place was safety.\n    \n      The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris.\n      It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance and its\n      house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung tenaciously to\n      ancient words, still called the porte cavaliere and the porte pietonne.16 The\n      Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission,\n      as we have already stated, to be buried there in a corner apart, and at\n      night, the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community. The\n      grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at\n      night in winter, in this cemetery, they were subjected to a special\n      discipline. The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at\n      sundown, and this being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was\n      bound by it like the rest. The carriage gate and the house door were two\n      contiguous grated gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect\n      Perronet, and inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates,\n      therefore, swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun\n      disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were\n      delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him\n      to get out\u2014his grave-digger's card furnished by the department of\n      public funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter's\n      window. The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard\n      it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man had not\n      his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and\n      asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with\n      his key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen\n      francs.\n    \n      \"Ah!\" said he, \"what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead, but\n      long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father Lenoir is?\n      He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Surene, morbigou! of real Paris\n      Surene? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he was a jolly\n      fellow. But you are a jolly fellow, too. Are you not, comrade? We'll go\n      and have a drink together presently.\"\n    \n      \"It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.\"\n    \n      As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.\n      Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of\n      gardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit, the prioress\n      recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a confession at the\n      same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving the convent, the\n      archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper to M. de Latil,\n      Monsieur's confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal. This\n      admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for it made its way to\n      Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning Pope, Leo XII.,\n      to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio's establishment in\n      Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della Genga; it contained\n      these lines: \"It appears that there is in a convent in Paris an excellent\n      gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent.\" Nothing of this triumph\n      reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went on grafting, weeding, and\n      covering up his melon beds, without in the least suspecting his\n      excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his glory, any more\n      than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published in the London\n      Illustrated News, with this inscription: \"Bull which carried off the prize\n      at the Cattle Show.\"\n    \n      Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the sisters\n      were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and adored\n      him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered the lowly\n      cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed out and felt\n      his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded Cosette. The\n      joy which we inspire has this charming property, that, far from growing\n      meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us more radiant than ever. At\n      recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her running and playing in the\n      distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest.\n    \n      Paris has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called the\n      sparrow; the child is called the gamin.\n    \n      Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the other\n      all the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; there\n      leaps out from them a little being. Homuncio, Plautus would say.\n    \n      Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively in the\n      corners; the lady-bird, the death's-head plant-louse, the daddy-long-legs,\n      \"the devil,\" a black insect, which menaces by twisting about its tail\n      armed with two horns. He has his fabulous monster, which has scales under\n      its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules on its back, but is not\n      a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns and wells that have run\n      dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls sometimes slowly,\n      sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has a look, and is so\n      terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls this monster \"the deaf\n      thing.\" The search for these \"deaf things\" among the stones is a joy of\n      formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a\n      paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice. Each region of Paris is\n      celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there.\n      There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the Ursulines, there are\n      millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in the ditches of the\n      Champs-de-Mars.\n    \n      This being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights, has rags like a baby\n      and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in the\n      cesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with his wit,\n      grins and bites, whistles and sings, shouts, and shrieks, tempers Alleluia\n      with Matantur-lurette, chants every rhythm from the De Profundis to the\n      Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he is ignorant of, is a\n      Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom, is lyrical to filth,\n      would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it\n      covered with stars. The gamin of Paris is Rabelais in this youth.\n    \n      Paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two beings of\n      which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which contents\n      itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhomme and\n      Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history. The whole of the\n      monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in the gamin.\n    \n      This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes\n      connections, \"grows supple\" in suffering, in the presence of social\n      realities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himself\n      heedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he is\n      on the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name is\n      Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice,\n      Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.\n    \n      Of what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful of\n      dirt, a breath, and behold Adam. It suffices for a God to pass by. A God\n      has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny being.\n      By the word \"fortune\" we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy kneaded\n      out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low. Will that\n      become an Ionian or a Boeotian? Wait, currit rota, the Spirit of Paris,\n      that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny,\n      reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an amphora.\n    \n      To roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fine\n      employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in that\n      rather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly but odd\n      and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain great cities, notably\n      Paris. To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal. End of the\n      trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginning of the\n      pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end of the\n      wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur, beginning\n      of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.\n    \n      He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of\n      Paris, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. That close-shaven\n      turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools, those harsh monotonies\n      of waste and fallow lands, the plants of early market-garden suddenly\n      springing into sight in a bottom, that mixture of the savage and the\n      citizen, those vast desert nooks where the garrison drums practise\n      noisily, and produce a sort of lisping of battle, those hermits by day and\n      cut-throats by night, that clumsy mill which turns in the wind, the\n      hoisting-wheels of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the corners of the\n      cemeteries; the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls squarely\n      intersecting immense, vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and\n      full of butterflies,\u2014all this attracted him.\n    \n      There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singular\n      spots, the Glaciere, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle all\n      speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on the\n      bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate de\n      Chatillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer serves\n      any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on a level\n      with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of Rome is\n      one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing but fields,\n      houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is to remain on\n      the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The spot where a\n      plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain\n      piercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same\n      time there. Local originalities there make their appearance.\n    \n      Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes\n      contiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos of\n      Paris, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the most\n      unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of a lugubrious\n      wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, dusty, ragged,\n      dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned with corn-flowers. All of\n      them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families. The\n      outer boulevard is their breathing space; the suburbs belong to them.\n      There they are eternally playing truant. There they innocently sing their\n      repertory of dirty songs. There they are, or rather, there they exist, far\n      from every eye, in the sweet light of May or June, kneeling round a hole\n      in the ground, snapping marbles with their thumbs, quarrelling over\n      half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile, free and happy; and, no sooner do\n      they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry,\n      and that they must earn their living, and they offer to sell you an old\n      woollen stocking filled with cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These\n      encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same\n      time poignant graces of the environs of Paris.\n    \n      Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earth to\n      those children. They never venture beyond this. They can no more escape\n      from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water. For\n      them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers: Ivry, Gentilly,\n      Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Menilmontant, Choisy-le-Roi,\n      Billancourt, Mendon, Issy, Vanvre, Sevres, Puteaux, Neuilly,\n      Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnieres, Bougival,\n      Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy, Gonesse; the\n      universe ends there.\n    \n      At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this book\n      takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at the corner\n      of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss here); stray\n      children abounded in Paris. The statistics give an average of two hundred\n      and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period, by the\n      police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction,\n      and under the arches of the bridges. One of these nests, which has become\n      famous, produced \"the swallows of the bridge of Arcola.\" This is,\n      moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. All crimes of the man\n      begin in the vagabondage of the child.\n    \n      Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative\n      measure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the\n      exception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is a\n      lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in some\n      sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public\n      vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy of Paris,\n      we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the surface, is\n      almost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing to put on record,\n      and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular\n      revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which\n      exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean. To\n      breathe Paris preserves the soul.\n    \n      What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which\n      one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around\n      whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family.\n      In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still is, it is\n      not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring\n      themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has become of\n      their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public\n      highway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for this sad thing\n      has given rise to an expression, \"to be cast on the pavements of Paris.\"\n    \n      Under Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them\n      off, for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whisp\u00e8red with terror\n      monstrous conjectures as to the king's baths of purple. Barbier speaks\n      ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the exempts of the\n      guard, when they ran short of children, took those who had fathers. The\n      fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that case, the parliament\n      intervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts? No, the fathers.\n    \n      The body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One might\n      almost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.\n    \n      This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profound\n      epiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,\u2014Dieu\n      de Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet seen\n      anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! (I have pronounced I'ave and\n      fifth pronounced fift'.)\n    \n      Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: \"Father So-and-So, your\n      wife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?\" \"What\n      would you have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves.\" But if the peasant's\n      whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the free-thinking\n      anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly, contained in this\n      other saying. A man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in\n      the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: \"He is talking to his black cap!\n      Oh, the sneak!\"\n    \n      The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, and\n      can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet.\n      He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their habits,\n      and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the souls of the\n      police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and without flinching:\n      \"Such an one is a traitor; such another is very malicious; such another is\n      great; such another is ridiculous.\" (All these words: traitor, malicious,\n      great, ridiculous, have a particular meaning in his mouth.) That one\n      imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, and he prevents people from walking\n      on the cornice outside the parapet; that other has a mania for pulling\n      person's ears; etc., etc.\n    \n      There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market;\n      Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic\n      spirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter, as\n      alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himself\n      eternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. Camille\n      Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treated\n      miracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a small\n      lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and of\n      Saint-Etienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevieve\n      familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.\n    \n      The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He has\n      villainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, and\n      handsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, he\n      would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on\n      boxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and\n      straightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even in the\n      presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the little\n      Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy was a\n      gamin of Paris; he Shouts: \"Forward!\" as the horse of Scripture says\n      \"Vah!\" and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant.\n    \n      To sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the graeculus\n      of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with the wrinkle of the\n      old world on his brow.\n    \n      All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts,\n      education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm you.\n      Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will present\n      itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth; and then,\n      those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea will have to\n      make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of Paris; flames in\n      the light or will-o'-the-wisps in the gloom.\n    \n      The gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.\n    \n      For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole of\n      this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living\n      manners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with\n      heaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, the\n      Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg\n      Saint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a Via\n      Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion; and it\n      replaces the Gemoniae by ridicule. Its majo is called \"faraud,\" its\n      Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its hammal is the market-porter,\n      its lazzarone is the pegre, its cockney is the native of Ghent. Everything\n      that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwoman of Dumarsais can\n      retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the discobols Vejanus lives again\n      in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer. Therapontigonus Miles could walk\n      arm in arm with Vadebonc\u0153ur the grenadier, Damasippus the\n      second-hand dealer would be happy among bric-a-brac merchants, Vincennes\n      could grasp Socrates in its fist as just as Agora could imprison Diderot,\n      Grimod de la Reyni\u00e8re discovered larded roast beef, as Curtillus invented\n      roast hedgehog, we see the trapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under\n      the vault of the Arc of l'Etoile, the sword-eater of Poecilus encountered\n      by Apuleius is a sword-swallower on the Pont Neuf, the nephew of Rameau\n      and Curculio the parasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself\n      presented to Cambaceres by d'Aigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome:\n      Alcesimarchus, Phoedromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend from\n      Courtille in Labatut's posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would halt no longer\n      in front of Congrio than would Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello;\n      Marto is not a tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the\n      wag jeers in the Cafe Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is\n      a tenor in the Champs-Elysees, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad\n      like Bobeche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the button\n      of your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two\n      thousand years Thesprion's apostrophe: Quis properantem me prehendit\n      pallio? The wine on Surene is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red border\n      of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro, Pere\n      Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains same gleams as the Esquiliae, and\n      the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly the equivalent\n      of the slave's hived coffin.\n    \n      Seek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius contains nothing\n      that is not in Mesmer's tub; Ergaphilas lives again in Cagliostro; the\n      Brahmin Vasaphanta become incarnate in the Comte de Saint-Germain; the\n      cemetery of Saint-Medard works quite as good miracles as the Mosque of\n      Oumoumie at Damascus.\n    \n      Paris has an AEsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. It is\n      terrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; it\n      makes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on the\n      throne, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether, if\n      Louis XV. is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better than Messalina.\n      Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existed and which we\n      have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and the Gascon pun. It\n      mingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, dresses up a spectre in old\n      numbers of the Constitutional, and makes Chodruc Duclos.\n    \n      Although Plutarch says: the tyrant never grows old, Rome, under Sylla as\n      under Domitian, resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine. The\n      Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by Varus\n      Vibiscus is to be credited: Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, Bibere\n      Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci. Paris drinks a million litres of\n      water a day, but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the\n      general alarm and ringing the tocsin.\n    \n      With that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally; it\n      is not too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot;\n      provided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it,\n      deformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric and you\n      may be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, does not\n      disgust it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before\n      Basile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horace\n      was repelled by the \"hiccup\" of Priapus. No trait of the universal face is\n      lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is not the polymnia dance\n      of the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies' wearing apparel there devours\n      the lorette with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla lay in wait\n      for the virgin Planesium. The Barriere du Combat is not the Coliseum, but\n      people are as ferocious there as though Caesar were looking on. The Syrian\n      hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil haunted the\n      Roman wine-shop, David d'Angers, Balzac and Charlet have sat at the tables\n      of Parisian taverns. Paris reigns. Geniuses flash forth there, the red\n      tails prosper there. Adonai passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels\n      of thunder and lightning; Silenus makes his entry there on his ass. For\n      Silenus read Ramponneau.\n    \n      Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem,\n      Pantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms\n      also. Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.\n    \n      There is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination which\n      sometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians!\n      exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the fashion;\n      Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris may be\n      stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury; then the\n      universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs its eyes,\n      says: \"How stupid I am!\" and bursts out laughing in the face of the human\n      race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing that this\n      grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors, that all\n      this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody, and\n      that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the Judgment Day,\n      and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign joviality. Its\n      gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.\n    \n      Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its days,\n      its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds of the\n      universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the mouth\n      of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks. It\n      imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highest\n      monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternity\n      to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has a prodigious 14th of July,\n      which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to take the oath of\n      tennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousand\n      years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will; it\n      multiplies itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime; it fills with\n      its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin,\n      Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere where the future is being\n      lighted up, at Boston in 1779, at the Isle de Leon in 1820, at Pesth in\n      1848, at Palermo in 1860, it whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in\n      the ear of the American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper's\n      Ferry, and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow,\n      to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it\n      creates Quiroga; it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it\n      was while proceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished at\n      Missolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune under the\n      feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre; its books,\n      its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, its philosophy, are the\n      manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, Regnier, Corneille, Descartes,\n      Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all moments, Moliere for all centuries; it\n      makes its language to be talked by the universal mouth, and that language\n      becomes the word; it constructs in all minds the idea of progress, the\n      liberating dogmas which it forges are for the generations trusty friends,\n      and it is with the soul of its thinkers and its poets that all heroes of\n      all nations have been made since 1789; this does not prevent vagabondism,\n      and that enormous genius which is called Paris, while transfiguring the\n      world by its light, sketches in charcoal Bouginier's nose on the wall of\n      the temple of Theseus and writes Credeville the thief on the Pyramids.\n    \n      Paris is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding it is laughing.\n    \n      Such is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. A\n      heap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. It is\n      more than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring.\n    \n      As for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always the\n      street Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for that\n      reason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. It is in\n      the faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears;\n      there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this people\n      toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of man. There\n      exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whom swarm types of\n      the strangest, from the porter of la Rap\u00e9e to the knacker of Montfaucon.\n      Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; mob, adds Burke, indignantly; rabble,\n      multitude, populace. These are words and quickly uttered. But so be it.\n      What does it matter? What is it to me if they do go barefoot! They do not\n      know how to read; so much the worse. Would you abandon them for that?\n      Would you turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot the light\n      penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and let us\n      obstinately persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows whether these\n      opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutions\n      transfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think\n      aloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with the\n      public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly,\n      proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear green\n      boughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This crowd may be\n      rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use of that vast conflagration\n      of principles and virtues, which sparkles, bursts forth and quivers at\n      certain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, these rags, these\n      ignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may be employed in the\n      conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the people, and you will perceive truth.\n      Let that vile sand which you trample under foot be cast into the furnace,\n      let it melt and seethe there, it will become a splendid crystal, and it is\n      thanks to it that Galileo and Newton will discover stars.\n    \n      At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternally decorated\n      with the placard: \"Chambers to let,\" chanced to be, a rare thing,\n      inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always the case in\n      Paris, had no connection with each other. All belonged to that indigent\n      class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in\n      straitened circumstances, and which extends from misery to misery into the\n      lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material\n      things of civilization end, the sewer-man who sweeps up the mud, and the\n      ragpicker who collects scraps.\n    \n      He lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned the\n      house. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the number\n      has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the\n      streets of Paris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the\n      first floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the very ceilings\n      with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes;\n      the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on\n      the arm-chairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast, nine-leaved screen of\n      Coromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung from the windows, and formed\n      great, broken folds that were very magnificent. The garden situated\n      immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which\n      formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long,\n      which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility. In\n      addition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had a boudoir of which he\n      thought a great deal, a gallant and elegant retreat, with magnificent\n      hangings of straw, with a pattern of flowers and fleurs-de-lys made on the\n      galleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne for his\n      mistress. M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal\n      great-aunt, who had died a centenarian. He had had two wives. His manners\n      were something between those of the courtier, which he had never been, and\n      the lawyer, which he might have been. He was gay, and caressing when he\n      had a mind. In his youth he had been one of those men who are always\n      deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses, because they are,\n      at the same time, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of\n      lovers in existence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in his\n      chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens,\n      executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a\n      confused and hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand's attire was not the habit\n      of Louis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyables\n      of the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period and had\n      followed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous\n      revers, a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons. With this he wore\n      knee-breeches and buckle shoes. He always thrust his hands into his fobs.\n      He said authoritatively: \"The French Revolution is a heap of blackguards.\"\n    \n      Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies, the\n      Moniteur, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been struck by a\n      name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name of Georges\n      Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier in\n      Saintonge's regiment. The revolution broke out. Saintonge's regiment\n      formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments of the\n      monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the\n      monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy fought at\n      Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, at Mayence, where he\n      was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard's rearguard. It was the\n      twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince of Hesse,\n      behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only rejoined the main body of\n      the army when the enemy's cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the\n      parapet to the foot of the glacis. He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and\n      at the battle of Mont-Palissel, where a ball from a biscaien broke his\n      arm. Then he passed to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty\n      grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert. Joubert was\n      appointed its adjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy\n      was by Berthier's side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi\n      which caused Bonaparte to say: \"Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and\n      grenadier.\" He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the\n      moment when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: \"Forward!\" Having been\n      embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign, on board a\n      pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast,\n      he fell into a wasps'-nest of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese\n      commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers\n      between decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel.\n      Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past\n      under the guns of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, his\n      audacity having increased, he attacked with his pinnace, and captured a\n      large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily, and which was\n      so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level\n      of the sea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg\n      from the Archduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms,\n      beneath a storm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head\n      of the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that\n      admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. When the\n      cavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of\n      the line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew\n      the Guard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at\n      Mantua, Melas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.\n      He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier\n      commanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the 55th\n      of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he was in\n      the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic Captain Louis\n      Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained alone with his\n      company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile army. Pontmercy\n      was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery. He was at\n      Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Beresina, then Lutzen, Bautzen,\n      Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail,\n      Chateau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne,\n      and the redoubtable position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a\n      captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword, and saved, not his general, but\n      his corporal. He was well slashed up on this occasion, and twenty-seven\n      splinters were extracted from his left arm alone. Eight days before the\n      capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the\n      cavalry. He had what was called under the old regime, the double hand,\n      that is to say, an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as\n      a soldier, or a squadron or a battalion as an officer. It is from this\n      aptitude, perfected by a military education, which certain special\n      branches of the service arise, the dragoons, for example, who are both\n      cavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied Napoleon\n      to the Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of\n      cuirassiers, in Dubois' brigade. It was he who captured the standard of\n      the Lunenburg battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor's feet.\n      He was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he had received a\n      sword-cut across his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him:\n      \"You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion of\n      Honor!\" Pontmercy replied: \"Sire, I thank you for my widow.\" An hour\n      later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was this Georges\n      Pontmercy? He was this same \"brigand of the Loire.\"\n    \n      While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away every\n      two or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breaking\n      his ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour when\n      Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the aunt\n      should turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not daring to\n      breathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was afraid of that old\n      spinster.\n    \n      With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of this\n      ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private\n      secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published, under\n      the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince de\n      Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty and\n      witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold\n      torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d'E******, the man in\n      all France who best understood \"proportioned politeness,\" the Comte\n      d'Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chevalier de\n      Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King's\n      cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont to\n      relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the galleys\n      as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix,\n      also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of a\n      soldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go at night and gather\n      up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been\n      guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs these dripping\n      corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the\n      back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night. These\n      tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.'s salon, and by dint of cursing\n      Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies of the undiscoverable\n      variety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de\n      Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M. Cornet-Dincourt.\n      The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches and his thin legs,\n      sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been\n      M. le Comte d'Artois' companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle\n      crouching under Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, and\n      in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a\n      bailiff. As for the priests, there was the Abb\u00e9 Halma, the same to whom M.\n      Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: \"Bah! Who is there who is not\n      fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?\" The Abb\u00e9 Letourneur, preacher\n      to the King, the Abb\u00e9 Frayssinous, who was not, as yet, either count, or\n      bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock whose buttons\n      were missing, and the Abb\u00e9 Keravenant, Cur\u00e9 of Saint-Germain-des-Pres;\n      also the Pope's Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi, Archbishop of Nisibi, later\n      on Cardinal, remarkable for his long, pensive nose, and another Monsignor,\n      entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of the seven\n      participant prothonotaries of the Holy See, Canon of the illustrious\n      Liberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, Postulatore dei Santi, which\n      refers to matters of canonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of\n      Requests of the section of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la\n      Luzerne, and M. de Cl****** T*******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer\n      and was destined to have, a few years later, the honor of signing in the\n      Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand; M. de Cl******\n      T******* was Archbishop of Toul****, and often made trips to Paris, to his\n      nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The\n      Cardinal of Cl****** T******* was a merry little man, who displayed his\n      red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred of\n      the Encyclopaedia, and his desperate play at billiards, and persons who,\n      at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings, where the\n      hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to the shock of\n      the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his\n      conclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: \"Mark,\n      Abb\u00e9, I make a cannon.\" The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had been brought\n      to Madame de T.'s by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former\n      Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was notable for\n      his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy; through the glass door\n      of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held\n      its meetings, the curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the\n      Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet\n      hose, with his back turned to the door, apparently for the purpose of\n      allowing a better view of his little collar. All these ecclesiastics,\n      though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to the\n      gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five\n      peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the\n      Marquis de Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********.\n      This Duc de Val********, although Prince de Mon***, that is to say a\n      reigning prince abroad, had so high an idea of France and its peerage,\n      that he viewed everything through their medium. It was he who said: \"The\n      Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lords are the peers of\n      France of England.\" Moreover, as it is indispensable that the Revolution\n      should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salon was, as we have\n      said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned there.\n    \n      There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.\n      There reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine.\n      There is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he\n      entered there, would have produced the effect of Pere Duchene. Some of the\n      scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. Comte\n      Beug*** was received there, subject to correction.\n    \n      \"For my son.\u2014The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of\n      Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\n      purchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will be\n      worthy of it is a matter of course.\" Below, the colonel had added: \"At\n      that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man's name was\n      Thenardier. I think that he has recently been keeping a little inn, in a\n      village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or Montfermeil. If my son\n      meets him, he will do all the good he can to Thenardier.\"\n    \n      Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment he\n      returned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies, with no\n      more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. In two days\n      the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.\n    \n      Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went straight\n      to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the Moniteur.\n    \n      He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side, who\n      led a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic hearth.\n      Lieutenant Theodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to\n      make what is called a fine officer. He had \"a lady's waist,\" a victorious\n      manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook. He\n      visited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that Marius had never seen him.\n      The cousins knew each other only by name. We think we have said that\n      Theodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, who preferred him because\n      she did not see him. Not seeing people permits one to attribute to them\n      all possible perfections.\n    \n      \"My heart says 'yes,' but my orders say 'no.' The matter is simple. They\n      are changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are being transferred\n      to Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris in order to get from the\n      old post to the new one. I said: 'I am going to see my aunt.'\"\n    \n      It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting\n      himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time that M.\n      Gillenormand had said: \"He is sleeping out.\"\n    \n      Lieutenant Theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this\n      unexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular and\n      disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which was\n      composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the colonel. He\n      retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and there was discipline\n      in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large epaulets, and he almost\n      made the military salute to him. Not knowing what to write to his aunt, he\n      decided not to write at all; and it is probable that nothing would have\n      resulted from the discovery made by Theodule as to the love affairs of\n      Marius, if, by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent\n      in chance, the scene at Vernon had not had an almost immediate\n      counter-shock at Paris.\n    \n      There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying\n      organizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; but\n      here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process of\n      throwing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there\n      existed at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society of\n      the Friends of the A B C.\n    \n      The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in the\n      state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended in\n      heroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market,\n      in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later on, and\n      near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Cafe\n      Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places was close to the\n      workingman, the second to the students.\n    \n      Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafes; the others\n      had habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. To saunter is\n      Parisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker\n      than appeared to view.\n    \n      Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there was\n      one sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic's name was\n      Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus: R.\n      Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything.\n      Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most during their\n      course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Cafe\n      Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire, that good cakes and\n      lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine,\n      spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, excellent matelotes at the\n      Barriere de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the Barriere du\n      Com pat. He knew the best place for everything; in addition, boxing and\n      foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough single-stick player.\n      He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately homely: the\n      prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged with his\n      homeliness, pronounced sentence on him as follows: \"Grantaire is\n      impossible\"; but Grantaire's fatuity was not to be disconcerted. He stared\n      tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the air of saying to them all: \"If\n      I only chose!\" and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in\n      general demand.\n    \n      \"I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has an\n      attack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be\n      applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a hideous\n      invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is worth\n      nothing. One breaks one's neck in living. Life is a theatre set in which\n      there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antique reliquary\n      painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: 'All is vanity.' I agree with\n      that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishing to go stark\n      naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up of everything\n      with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, an\n      acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a\n      wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman,\n      a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has a right and a wrong side; the\n      right side is stupid, it is the negro with his glass beads; the wrong side\n      is foolish, it is the philosopher with his rags. I weep over the one and I\n      laugh over the other. What are called honors and dignities, and even\n      dignity and honor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of\n      human pride. Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of\n      a sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and\n      Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no longer\n      respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of\n      neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a\n      setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout\n      woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am\n      ignorant, otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things; but I know\n      nothing. For instance, I have always been witty; when I was a pupil of\n      Gros, instead of daubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time in\n      pilfering apples; rapin24 is the masculine of rapine. So much for myself; as\n      for the rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your\n      perfections, excellencies, and qualities. Every good quality tends towards\n      a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the\n      prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very\n      pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as\n      there are holes in Diogenes' cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain or the\n      slayer, Caesar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long\n      live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but\n      madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who\n      killed Caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue was\n      from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved that\n      figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which Nero\n      carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two statues\n      which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with the one,\n      Nero with the other. All history is nothing but wearisome repetition. One\n      century is the plagiarist of the other. The battle of Marengo copies the\n      battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are\n      as like each other as two drops of water. I don't attach much importance\n      to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to conquer; true glory lies in\n      convincing. But try to prove something! If you are content with success,\n      what mediocrity, and with conquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity and\n      cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si volet\n      usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdain the human race. Shall we descend to\n      the party at all? Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples? What\n      people, if you please? Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians\n      of days gone by, slew Phocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon\n      tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: \"His urine\n      attracts the bees.\" The most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was\n      that grammarian Philetas, who was so small and so thin that he was obliged\n      to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind.\n      There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and\n      catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What did\n      Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us\n      pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? France?\n      Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England?\n      Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis\n      of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths\n      a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I\n      add, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath\n      of roses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire\n      John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for\n      that slave-holding brother. Take away Time is money, what remains of\n      England? Take away Cotton is king, what remains of America? Germany is the\n      lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire\n      admired it. He also admired China. I admit that Russia has its beauties,\n      among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots. Their health is\n      delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul,\n      another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, with their\n      throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all this indicates\n      that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in a condition of flagrant\n      insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration of\n      the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and sums up all the\n      forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges\n      of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful\n      Pass. 'Bah!' you will say to me, 'but Europe is certainly better than\n      Asia?' I admit that Asia is a farce; but I do not precisely see what you\n      find to laugh at in the Grand Lama, you peoples of the west, who have\n      mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of\n      majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of\n      the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it! It\n      is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most\n      brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London\n      the most wine, at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most\n      absinthe; there are all the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in\n      short. In Paris, even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have\n      loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a\n      philosopher at the Piraeus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the\n      ragpickers are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and\n      The Slaughter-House. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis,\n      mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers,\n      caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat\n      at Richard's at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to roll\n      naked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good\n      day.\"\n    \n      It chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Theodule belonged came to\n      perform garrison duty in Paris. This inspired Aunt Gillenormand with a\n      second idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan of having\n      Marius spied upon by Theodule; now she plotted to have Theodule take\n      Marius' place.\n    \n      Then he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew, who\n      was merely some Theodule or other, and soon flew into a rage, which almost\n      always happened when he read. The \"sheet\" which he held, although\n      Royalist, of course, announced for the following day, without any\n      softening phrases, one of these little events which were of daily\n      occurrence at that date in Paris: \"That the students of the schools of law\n      and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Pantheon, at midday,\u2014to\n      deliberate.\" The discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment,\n      the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict between the Minister\n      of War and \"the citizen's militia,\" on the subject of the cannon parked in\n      the courtyard of the Louvre. The students were to \"deliberate\" over this.\n      It did not take much more than this to swell M. Gillenormand's rage.\n    \n      He went straight to \"his alley,\" and when he reached the end of it he\n      perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when he\n      approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that it\n      was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a tall and\n      beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at\n      the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most\n      ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which can be\n      expressed only by these two words,\u2014\"fifteen years.\" She had\n      wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemed made\n      of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitated\n      whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like sunbeams, and\n      words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set\n      upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus. And, in\n      order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose was\n      not handsome\u2014it was pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither\n      Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that is to say, spiritual,\n      delicate, irregular, pure,\u2014which drives painters to despair, and\n      charms poets.\n    \n      A quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnasse\n      governed the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.\n    \n      Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to \"undertake Paris.\" This\n      was his expression.\n    \n      These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber\n      with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that\n      monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.\n    \n      There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was no\n      one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the boulevard\n      in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier,\n      on its way back to Paris.\n    \n      \"Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the\n      parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread!\n      I have had enough of misery! my share and other people's share! I am not\n      joking any longer, I don't find it comic any more, I've had enough of\n      puns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am\n      full, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I\n      want to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit\n      of a millionnaire!\"\n    \n      But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not\n      know their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes,\n      and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should\n      he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock, at the\n      moment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his men\n      would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger than\n      he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and the man\n      whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock had just\n      struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours before\n      him.\n    \n      \"How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!\" said she.\n    \n      The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the\n      Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent\n      and sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most retired\n      chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in\n      Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already existed, they\n      would have been invented there.\n    \n      He called it the best of republics. The town-hall of Paris took the place\n      of the Cathedral of Rheims.\n    \n      The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince de\n      Conde engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as Paris did\n      the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince and giving\n      herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas, behind us the\n      demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in Portugal, the earth\n      quaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand over Bologna, France\n      treating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North no one knew what sinister\n      sound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her coffin, irritated glances\n      watching France narrowly all over Europe, England, a suspected ally, ready\n      to give a push to that which was tottering and to hurl herself on that\n      which should fall, the peerage sheltering itself behind Beccaria to refuse\n      four heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lys erased from the King's carriage,\n      the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined,\n      Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir Perier dead in the exhaustion\n      of his power; political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in\n      the two capitals of the kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other\n      in the city of toil; at Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two\n      cities, the same glare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow\n      of the people; the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse\n      de Berry in la Vendee, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, added the\n      sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.\n    \n      Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. The\n      fermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partial\n      revolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly suppressed,\n      but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlying\n      conflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could be\n      caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a\n      possible revolution. France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the\n      Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\n    \n      \"Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris any\n      more.\"\n    \n      Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris nor in\n      France was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. Like those\n      membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human\n      body, the network of secret societies began to spread all over the\n      country. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which was at\n      the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights of Man,\n      which also dated from one of the orders of the day: Pluviose, Year 40 of\n      the republican era, which was destined to survive even the mandate of the\n      Court of Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and which did not\n      hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following:\u2014\n    \n      The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, Lyons,\n      Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the Rights of Man,\n      the Charbonniere, and The Free Men. All had a revolutionary society which\n      was called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.\n    \n      In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the\n      Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than the\n      faubourgs. A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the\n      Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallying\n      points for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B C\n      affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix, met,\n      as we have seen, in the Cafe Musain. These same young men assembled also,\n      as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mondetour\n      which was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Others were as\n      public as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldness from these\n      fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior\n      prosecutions: \"Where was this meeting held?\" \"In the Rue de la Paix.\" \"At\n      whose house?\" \"In the street.\" \"What sections were there?\" \"Only one.\"\n      \"Which?\" \"The Manuel section.\" \"Who was its leader?\" \"I.\" \"You are too\n      young to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking the\n      government. Where did your instructions come from?\" \"From the central\n      committee.\"\n    \n      The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it\n      received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,\n      slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times of\n      revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it deals\n      rebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to the\n      highest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt to\n      explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the fall\n      of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the\n      wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg\n      Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very\n      gates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.\n    \n      Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in the\n      early days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with\n      uplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in\n      an uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an end to\n      tyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for the child,\n      social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread for\n      all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress; and that\n      holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible wise,\n      driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist, a roar in\n      their mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages of civilization.\n    \n      Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the\n      plain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in\n      that side of Paris.\n    \n      As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation in\n      review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When\n      facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the\n      slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence\n      arises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath\n      the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment was at\n      hand. The people were again taking possession of right, and what a fine\n      spectacle! The revolution was again majestically taking possession of\n      France and saying to the world: \"The sequel to-morrow!\" Enjolras was\n      content. The furnace was being heated. He had at that moment a powder\n      train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his own mind,\n      with Combeferre's philosophical and penetrating eloquence, Feuilly's\n      cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac's dash, Bahorel's smile, Jean\n      Prouvaire's melancholy, Joly's science, Bossuet's sarcasms, a sort of\n      electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once. All hands to\n      work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort. This was well. This\n      made him think of Grantaire.\n    \n      When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one side\n      and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach the Rue\n      de la Sant\u00e9, then the Glaciere, and, a little while before arriving at the\n      little river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of field which is the\n      only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of Paris,\n      where Ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down.\n    \n      About the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament of\n      Paris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period the\n      grand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois concealed\n      them, had \"a little house\" built in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the\n      deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue Plumet, not far from the spot\n      which was then designated as Combat des Animaux.\n    \n      He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was\n      necessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years' sojourn between\n      these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or\n      dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men. He\n      had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would recognize him\n      now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself, and\n      he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason that he\n      had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger in comparison\n      with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being prudent and taking\n      his precautions.\n    \n      At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that he\n      might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same\n      quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the slightest\n      disquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that he might not\n      again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously\n      escaped from Javert. These two apartments were very pitiable, poor in\n      appearance, and in two quarters which were far remote from each other, the\n      one in the Rue de l'Ouest, the other in the Rue de l'Homme Arme.\n    \n      He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, now to the Rue\n      de l'Ouest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint. He had\n      himself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a gentleman from\n      the suburbs, living on his funds, and having a little temporary\n      resting-place in town. This lofty virtue had three domiciles in Paris for\n      the sake of escaping from the police.\n    \n      It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side,\n      the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces\n      away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputies not\n      far off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue\n      Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain did\n      the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other's course at\n      the neighboring cross-roads; the Rue Plumet was the desert; and the death\n      of the former proprietors, the revolution which had passed over it, the\n      crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness, forty years of\n      abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot\n      ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great crimped plants, with\n      large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy and rapid\n      insects; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to\n      reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage\n      grandeur; and for nature, which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man,\n      and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at\n      all, in the ant as well as in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little\n      Parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest\n      of the New World.\n    \n      Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayed\n      morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The\n      Thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. She\n      remembered that she had gone \"one day, at night,\" to fetch water in a\n      forest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed to her\n      that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean who\n      had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a\n      time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders, and\n      serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep, as she\n      had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean's daughter, and that\n      he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into\n      that good man and had come to dwell near her.\n    \n      With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her. She\n      conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat. Her\n      father had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the whole\n      science of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the stuff\n      which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that science which makes\n      of the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and so dangerous.\n      The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne.\n    \n      In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue de\n      Babylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the \"best dressed\"\n      women in Paris, which means a great deal more.\n    \n      At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It is\n      the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He\n      had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. He\n      would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm by\n      some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have just\n      said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very\n      childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the\n      imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on\n      horseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the\n      commandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would\n      be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an\n      incontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be\n      dazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the\n      Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice for\n      Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.\n    \n      Jean Valjean's inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least\n      frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then\n      existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows,\n      which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in summer sickly\n      grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been gathered,\n      presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but peeled. Jean\n      Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored there. It meant\n      solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a little girl once\n      more, she could run and almost play; she took off her hat, laid it on Jean\n      Valjean's knees, and gathered bunches of flowers. She gazed at the\n      butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness and\n      tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within her\n      breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly.\n      She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed on her head, and which,\n      crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing until they flamed, formed\n      for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.\n    \n      This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the\n      barrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,\n      sprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as is\n      frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of the road\n      and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to\n      each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze\n      were audible.\n    \n      All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to be\n      found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, bald\n      heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savage grins,\n      senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those of young\n      girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages, and by\n      reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which death alone was\n      lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave, in all\n      probability, and who could make a comparison of his chains. The frightful\n      leveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows; at that degree of\n      abasement, the last transformations were suffered by all in their\n      extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, was the equal of\n      intelligence converted into despair. There was no choice possible between\n      these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud. It was evident\n      that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had\n      not classified them. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell,\n      in alphabetical disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts.\n      Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving a\n      result; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, each chain exhaled\n      a common soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By the side of\n      the one where they were singing, there was one where they were howling; a\n      third where they were begging; one could be seen in which they were\n      gnashing their teeth; another load menaced the spectators, another\n      blasphemed God; the last was as silent as the tomb. Dante would have\n      thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march. The march\n      of the damned to their tortures, performed in sinister wise, not on the\n      formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, but, what was more\n      mournful than that, on the gibbet cart.\n    \n      Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day, there\n      was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,\u2014fetes in\n      Paris, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical\n      performances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks at the Arc de l'Etoile,\n      illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and\n      took Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her\n      from the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling\n      tumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her. The\n      review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms\n      perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a national guard\n      with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter.\n      However, this trip seemed to attain its object. Cosette, who made it her\n      law to please her father, and to whom, moreover, all spectacles were a\n      novelty, accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of\n      youth, and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment\n      called a public fete; so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had\n      succeeded, and that no trace of that hideous vision remained.\n    \n      It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion\n      in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some adventure.\n    \n      The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the same\n      one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two children\n      which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Celestins, at the corner of\n      this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the opportunity\n      of changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader will remember the\n      great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the Seine in\n      Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science took advantage to make\n      experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum, so\n      beneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture of\n      iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both her boys, who were\n      still very young, one in the morning, the other in the evening of the same\n      day. This was a blow. These children were precious to their mother; they\n      represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were punctually\n      paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by collector of his rents, M. Barge,\n      a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the\n      income was at an end. The Magnon sought an expedient. In that dark\n      free-masonry of evil of which she formed a part, everything is known, all\n      secrets are kept, and all lend mutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the\n      Thenardiers had two. The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for\n      the one, a good investment for the other. The little Thenardiers became\n      little Magnons. Magnon quitted the Quai des Celestins and went to live in\n      the Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to\n      himself is broken between one street and another.\n    \n      Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was\n      careful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished in\n      an affected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized English thief.\n      This English woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne, recommended\n      by very wealthy relations, intimately connected with the medals in the\n      Library and Mademoiselle Mar's diamonds, became celebrated later on in\n      judicial accounts. She was called Mamselle Miss.\n    \n      Spring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do\n      not precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden the\n      most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air\n      which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or\n      window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar,\n      and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the spring of 1832, the\n      epoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in Europe,\n      these north gales were more harsh and piercing than ever. It was a door\n      even more glacial than that of winter which was ajar. It was the door of\n      the sepulchre. In these winds one felt the breath of the cholera.\n    \n      Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of\n      the Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in the\n      ancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which has\n      already been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved to\n      leave some trace, for it was the idea of a \"member of the Institute, the\n      General-in-chief of the army of Egypt.\"\n    \n      \"The Paris brat ain't made of straw,\" added Brujon.\n    \n      In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses it\n      in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it often\n      confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and summary\n      fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed and\n      complicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are formed, in\n      which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements, the\n      direct creation and the metaphor: le cab jaspine, je marronne que la\n      roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri, the dog is barking, I suspect that\n      the diligence for Paris is passing through the woods. Le dab est sinve, la\n      dabuge est merloussiere, la f\u00e9e est bative, the bourgeois is stupid, the\n      bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty. Generally, to throw\n      listeners off the track, slang confines itself to adding to all the words\n      of the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in\n      aille, in orgue, in iergue, or in uche. Thus: Vousiergue trouvaille\n      bonorgue ce gigotmuche? Do you think that leg of mutton good? A phrase\n      addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum\n      offered for his escape suited him.\n    \n      There existed at the Chatelet in Paris a large and long cellar. This\n      cellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither windows\n      nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter there, air\n      could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and for floor ten\n      inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had rotted and cracked\n      under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor, a long and\n      massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side;\n      from this beam hung, at short distances apart, chains three feet long, and\n      at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck. In this vault,\n      men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day\n      of their departure for Toulon. They were thrust under this beam, where\n      each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him.\n    \n      It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth. It\n      is from the dungeon of the Grand-Chatelet of Paris that comes the\n      melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: \"Timaloumisaine,\n      timaloumison.\" The majority of these\n    \n      They existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not notice\n      the cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. They\n      had confided in each other as far as possible, but this had not extended\n      much further than their names. Marius had told Cosette that he was an\n      orphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a lawyer, that he\n      lived by writing things for publishers, that his father had been a\n      colonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on bad\n      terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at being a\n      baron, but this had produced no effect on Cosette. She did not know the\n      meaning of the word. Marius was Marius. On her side, she had confided to\n      him that she had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus convent, that her\n      mother, like his own, was dead, that her father's name was M.\n      Fauchelevent, that he was very good, that he gave a great deal to the\n      poor, but that he was poor himself, and that he denied himself everything\n      though he denied her nothing.\n    \n      The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessary\n      to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the\n      horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, at\n      nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening, with\n      the same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sight of Eponine\n      approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two days in succession\u2014this\n      was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the boulevard, changed his\n      course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur.\n    \n      \"Under Pantin [Paris].\"\n    \n      Moreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented this\n      inconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in his life,\n      that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and that while\n      seeking to ferret out a man like Pepin or Morey, they might very readily\n      discover a man like Jean Valjean.\n    \n      Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and go\n      over to England.\n    \n      All day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; it\n      rained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased a\n      penny roll at a baker's, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appears\n      that he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are\n      moments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passing\n      through one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything; this step\n      he had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night with\n      feverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before his mind;\u2014this\n      was, that at nine o'clock he should see Cosette. This last happiness now\n      constituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, as he\n      roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that he\n      heard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his revery and\n      said: \"Is there fighting on hand?\"\n    \n      Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette was\n      not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed the\n      thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: \"She is\n      waiting for me there,\" said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his eyes,\n      and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the tour of\n      the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the house, and,\n      rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified, exasperated with grief\n      and uneasiness, like a master who returns home at an evil hour, he tapped\n      on the shutters. He knocked and knocked again, at the risk of seeing the\n      window open, and her father's gloomy face make its appearance, and demand:\n      \"What do you want?\" This was nothing in comparison with what he dimly\n      caught a glimpse of. When he had rapped, he lifted up his voice and called\n      Cosette.\u2014\"Cosette!\" he cried; \"Cosette!\" he repeated imperiously.\n      There was no reply. All was over. No one in the garden; no one in the\n      house.\n    \n      In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. They resembled\n      shots and the clamors of a multitude.\n    \n      \"No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the\n      pavements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war of\n      thickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other the heart\n      of cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne. Revolts have\n      illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the Parisian\n      character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, students proving that\n      bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard invincible,\n      bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins, contempt of death\n      on the part of passers-by. Schools and legions clashed together. After\n      all, between the combatants, there was only a difference of age; the race\n      is the same; it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty for\n      their ideas, at forty for their families. The army, always a sad thing in\n      civil wars, opposed prudence to audacity. Uprisings, while proving popular\n      intrepidity, also educated the courage of the bourgeois.\n    \n      \"This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the bloodshed\n      add the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness among the best\n      men, honest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism happy in these wounds\n      dealt to revolution by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830 triumphing and\n      saying: 'We told you so!' Add Paris enlarged, possibly, but France most\n      assuredly diminished. Add, for all must needs be told, the massacres which\n      have too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious over\n      liberty gone mad. To sum up all, uprisings have been disastrous.\"\n    \n      There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as\n      insurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the wrong,\n      the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones which are\n      founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps; then\n      the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far\n      as resort to arms. In all questions which result from collective\n      sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection;\n      the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt; according as the\n      Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are justly or unjustly\n      attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the populace, is wrong on the\n      10th of August, and right on the 14th of Vendemiaire. Alike in appearance,\n      fundamentally different in reality; the Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte\n      defends the true. That which universal suffrage has effected in its\n      liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is the\n      same in things pertaining purely to civilization; the instinct of the\n      masses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury\n      legitimate when directed against Terray and absurd when directed against\n      Turgot. The destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the\n      breaking of rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of\n      multitudes, the refusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus\n      assassinated by students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,\u2014that\n      is revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against\n      Cicero,\u2014that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,\u2014that\n      is insurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against\n      Christopher Columbus,\u2014this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why?\n      Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which Christopher\n      Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander like Columbus,\n      is finding a world. These gifts of a world to civilization are such\n      augmentations of light, that all resistance in that case is culpable.\n      Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself. The masses are\n      traitors to the people. Is there, for example, anything stranger than that\n      long and bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt, a legitimate\n      chronic revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on the day of salvation, at\n      the very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne, turns into\n      chouannerie, and, from having been an insurrection against, becomes an\n      uprising for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance! The contraband salt dealer\n      escapes the royal gibbets, and with a rope's end round his neck, mounts\n      the white cockade. \"Death to the salt duties,\" brings forth, \"Long live\n      the King!\" The assassins of Saint-Barthelemy, the cut-throats of\n      September, the manslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, the\n      assassins of Madam Lamballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets,\n      Cadenettes, the companions of Jehu, the chevaliers of Brassard,\u2014behold\n      an uprising. La Vendee is a grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right\n      in movement is recognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling\n      of excited masses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all\n      tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and\n      ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in\n      what direction you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you\n      may grow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction.\n      Any other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a\n      revolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race.\n      Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements which\n      the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These pavements\n      bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against Louis XIV. is\n      insurrection; Hebert against Danton is revolt.\n    \n      This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of Parisians\n      calls \"the epoch of the riots,\" is certainly a characteristic hour amid\n      the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we enter on the\n      recital.\n    \n      In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all minds\n      for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an\n      indescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripe\n      for commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece of\n      artillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and the\n      shot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of General\n      Lamarque.\n    \n      On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, General\n      Lamarque's funeral procession traversed Paris with official military pomp,\n      somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with draped drums\n      and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with their swords at\n      their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men. The\n      officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurel\n      branches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the\n      sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical\n      School, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German, and\n      Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort of\n      banner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters and carpenters who\n      were on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by their\n      paper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearly\n      all of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order and\n      yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column. Squads\n      chose themselves leaders; a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view,\n      seemed to pass the host in review, and the files separated before him. On\n      the side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches of the trees, on\n      balconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men, women, and\n      children; all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throng was passing,\n      and a terrified throng looked on.\n    \n      The Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed with its\n      hand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the\n      Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their head,\n      cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in readiness to march; in\n      the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the Municipal Guard\n      echelonned from street to street; at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron of\n      dragoons; at the Greve half of the 12th Light Infantry, the other half\n      being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the Celestins; and the\n      courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery. The remainder of the troops\n      were confined to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of the\n      environs of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacing\n      multitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in\n      the banlieue.\n    \n      Then all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a fusillade\n      breaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank, and\n      pass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of the\n      Isle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, bristle with combatants,\n      stakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun, the young men\n      who are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run,\n      and the municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply their\n      swords, the crowd disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies to all\n      four quarters of Paris, men shout: \"To arms!\" they run, tumble down, flee,\n      resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire.\n    \n      A quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at\n      twenty different spots in Paris at once.\n    \n      All that we are here relating slowly and successively took place\n      simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult,\n      like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder. In less than\n      an hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of\n      the Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house No. 50, which was\n      the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions, and which, flanked\n      on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and on the other by a\n      barricade of the Rue Maubuee, commanded three streets, the Rue des Arcis,\n      the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which it faced. The\n      barricades at right angles fell back, the one of the Rue Montorgueil on\n      the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue\n      Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other\n      quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Genevieve; one in the Rue\n      Menilmontant, where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges;\n      another near the little bridge of the Hotel-Dieu made with an \"ecossais,\"\n      which had been unharnessed and overthrown, three hundred paces from the\n      Prefecture of Police.\n    \n      At the barricade of the Rue des Menetriers, a well-dressed man distributed\n      money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat, a horseman\n      made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander\n      of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver. \"Here,\" said\n      he, \"this is to pay expenses, wine, et caetera.\" A light-haired young man,\n      without a cravat, went from barricade to barricade, carrying pass-words.\n      Another, with a naked sword, a blue police cap on his head, placed\n      sentinels. In the interior, beyond the barricades, the wine-shops and\n      porters' lodges were converted into guard-houses. Otherwise the riot was\n      conducted after the most scientific military tactics. The narrow, uneven,\n      sinuous streets, full of angles and turns, were admirably chosen; the\n      neighborhood of the Halles, in particular, a network of streets more\n      intricate than a forest. The Society of the Friends of the People had, it\n      was said, undertaken to direct the insurrection in the Quartier\n      Sainte-Avoye. A man killed in the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on\n      his person a plan of Paris.\n    \n      That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort\n      of strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrection had abruptly\n      built barricades with one hand, and with the other seized nearly all the\n      posts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like a train of powder\n      catching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied, on the right bank,\n      the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the whole of the Marais,\n      the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the Chateau-d'Eau, and all\n      the streets near the Halles; on the left bank, the barracks of the\n      Veterans, Sainte-Pelagie, the Place Maubert, the powder magazine of the\n      Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five o'clock in the evening, they\n      were masters of the Bastille, of the Lingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux;\n      their scouts had reached the Place des Victoires, and menaced the Bank,\n      the Petits-Peres barracks, and the Post-Office. A third of Paris was in\n      the hands of the rioters.\n    \n      The insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of inextricable,\n      tortuous, colossal citadel.\n    \n      During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more than\n      one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than the\n      physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the\n      rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything,\u2014it\n      is only a riot,\u2014and Paris has so many affairs on hand, that she does\n      not put herself out for so small a matter. These colossal cities alone can\n      offer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alone can contain at the\n      same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity. Ordinarily,\n      when an insurrection commences, when the shop-keeper hears the drum, the\n      call to arms, the general alarm, he contents himself with the remark:\u2014\n    \n      Nothing can be stranger; and this is the peculiar character of uprisings\n      in Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. To this end, two\n      things are requisite, the size of Paris and its gayety. The city of\n      Voltaire and Napoleon is necessary.\n    \n      Alarming details were hawked about, fatal news was disseminated,\u2014that\n      they were masters of the Bank;\u2014that there were six hundred of them\n      in the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled in the\n      church; that the line was not to be depended on; that Armand Carrel had\n      been to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: \"Get a regiment\n      first\"; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them,\n      nevertheless: \"I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room for\n      a chair\"; that one must be on one's guard; that at night there would be\n      people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of Paris\n      (there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe mixed up with\n      the Government was recognizable); that a battery had been established in\n      the Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting their heads\n      together, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, four columns\n      would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, the first coming\n      from the Bastille, the second from the Porte Saint-Martin, the third from\n      the Greve, the fourth from the Halles; that perhaps, also, the troops\n      would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars; that no one knew\n      what would happen, but that this time, it certainly was serious.\n    \n      At the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called the Rue\n      de Paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of\n      prisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly. All that\n      straw rustled by all these men, produced the sound of a heavy shower.\n      Elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows, piled on top of\n      each other.\n    \n      Anxiety reigned everywhere, and a certain tremor which was not habitual\n      with Paris.\n    \n      They waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of the\n      streets and disappeared, shouting: \"Go home!\" And people made haste to\n      bolt their doors. They said: \"How will all this end?\" From moment to\n      moment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take on a\n      more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.\n    \n      Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march,\n      and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? We\n      know not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well up\n      in all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his own\n      chirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of the\n      voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of the\n      birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves,\n      a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it appears, been for three months\n      apprenticed to a printer. He had one day executed a commission for M.\n      Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters.\n    \n      Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered\n      the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainy\n      night, it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of\n      Providence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning; that\n      is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets at\n      daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artistically\n      extracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort of\n      breakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, confiding them to\n      that good mother, the street, who had brought him up, almost entirely. On\n      leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the\n      evening, and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell: \"I break a\n      cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as they say at the court, I\n      file off. If you don't find papa and mamma, young 'uns, come back here\n      this evening. I'll scramble you up some supper, and I'll give you a\n      shakedown.\" The two children, picked up by some policeman and placed in\n      the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank, or having simply strayed off in\n      that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris, did not return. The lowest depths\n      of the actual social world are full of these lost traces. Gavroche did not\n      see them again. Ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night. More\n      than once he had scratched the back of his head and said: \"Where the devil\n      are my two children?\"\n    \n      Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags;\n      and the \"Thou shalt be King\" could be quite as mournfully hurled at\n      Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr.\n      The croak would be almost identical.\n    \n      He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most\n      peaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a Lenten\n      admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his \"flock.\"\n    \n      The Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end\n      near the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondetour, a\n      basket-maker's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleon\n      the Great with this inscription:\u2014\n    \n      May we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital, to\n      the simple means which we have already employed in the case of Waterloo.\n      Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the\n      constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the Pointe\n      Saint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of Paris, where\n      to-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only to imagine an N\n      touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the Halles with its base,\n      and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie,\n      and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transverse bar should be formed by\n      the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue Mondetour cut the three\n      strokes of the N at the most crooked angles. So that the labyrinthine\n      confusion of these four streets sufficed to form, on a space three fathoms\n      square, between the Halles and the Rue Saint-Denis on the one hand, and\n      between the Rue du Cygne and the Rue des Pr\u00eacheurs on the other, seven\n      islands of houses, oddly cut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise and\n      hap-hazard, and barely separated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, by\n      narrow crannies.\n    \n      \"How quiet this street is!\" exclaimed Laigle. \"Who would suspect that\n      Paris was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen that in former\n      days there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood! Du Breul\n      and Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abb\u00e9 Lebeuf. They were all\n      round here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted, shaven, bearded,\n      gray, black, white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins, Carmelites, Little\n      Augustines, Great Augustines, old Augustines\u2014there was no end of\n      them.\"\n    \n      \"Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the grisette\n      is an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other.\n      So we believe in nothing. There is but one reality: drink. Whatever your\n      opinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, or in\n      favor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little,\n      drink. You talk to me of the boulevard, of that procession, et caetera, et\n      caetera. Come now, is there going to be another revolution? This poverty\n      of means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keep greasing\n      the groove of events every moment. There is a hitch, it won't work. Quick,\n      a revolution! The good God has his hands perpetually black with that\n      cart-grease. If I were in his place, I'd be perfectly simple about it, I\n      would not wind up my mechanism every minute, I'd lead the human race in a\n      straightforward way, I'd weave matters mesh by mesh, without breaking the\n      thread, I would have no provisional arrangements, I would have no\n      extraordinary repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by\n      means of two motors, men and events. But, sad to say, from time to time,\n      the exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices neither\n      for event nor for men: among men geniuses are required, among events\n      revolutions. Great accidents are the law; the order of things cannot do\n      without them; and, judging from the apparition of comets, one would be\n      tempted to think that Heaven itself finds actors needed for its\n      performance. At the moment when one expects it the least, God placards a\n      meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star turns up, underlined\n      by an enormous tail. And that causes the death of Caesar. Brutus deals him\n      a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a comet. Crac, and behold an\n      aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a great man; '93 in big\n      letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at the head of the poster.\n      Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes!\n      Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! Raise your eyes, boobies. Everything is in\n      disorder, the star as well as the drama. Good God, it is too much and not\n      enough. These resources, gathered from exception, seem magnificence and\n      poverty. My friends, Providence has come down to expedients. What does a\n      revolution prove? That God is in a quandry. He effects a coup d'etat\n      because he, God, has not been able to make both ends meet. In fact, this\n      confirms me in my conjectures as to Jehovah's fortune; and when I see so\n      much distress in heaven and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of\n      millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income, when I see\n      human destiny, which is very badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is\n      threadbare, witness the Prince de Conde hung, when I see winter, which is\n      nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows, when I see\n      so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests\n      of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the\n      frost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up,\n      and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see so\n      much misery everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich. The appearance\n      exists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard up. He gives a revolution\n      as a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives a ball. God must not be\n      judged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of heaven I perceive a\n      poverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt. That is why I am\n      discontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost night; ever since\n      this morning I have been waiting for daylight to come; it has not come,\n      and I bet that it won't come all day. This is the inexactness of an\n      ill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anything\n      else, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition,\n      everything goes awry; the universe is a tease. It's like children, those\n      who want them have none, and those who don't want them have them. Total:\n      I'm vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, that bald-head, offends my sight. It\n      humiliates me to think that I am of the same age as that baldy. However, I\n      criticise, but I do not insult. The universe is what it is. I speak here\n      without evil intent and to ease my conscience. Receive, Eternal Father,\n      the assurance of my distinguished consideration. Ah! by all the saints of\n      Olympus and by all the gods of paradise, I was not intended to be a\n      Parisian, that is to say, to rebound forever, like a shuttlecock between\n      two battledores, from the group of the loungers to the group of the\n      roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watching oriental houris all day\n      long, executing those exquisite Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream\n      of a chaste man, or a Beauceron peasant, or a Venetian gentleman\n      surrounded by gentlewoman, or a petty German prince, furnishing the half\n      of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation, and occupying his leisure\n      with drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to say, his frontier. Those\n      are the positions for which I was born! Yes, I have said a Turk, and I\n      will not retract. I do not understand how people can habitually take Turks\n      in bad part; Mohammed had his good points; respect for the inventor of\n      seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques! Let us not insult\n      Mohammedanism, the only religion which is ornamented with a hen-roost!\n      Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a great piece of stupidity. And it\n      appears that they are going to fight, all those imbeciles, and to break\n      each other's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer,\n      in the month of June, when they might go off with a creature on their arm,\n      to breathe the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows! Really,\n      people do commit altogether too many follies. An old broken lantern which\n      I have just seen at a bric-a-brac merchant's suggests a reflection to my\n      mind; it is time to enlighten the human race. Yes, behold me sad again.\n      That's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way!\n      I am growing melancholy once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive,\n      turn each other out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, and get used\n      to it!\"\n    \n      Nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this\n      troop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols,\n      another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-horn\n      slung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper\n      and was armed with a saddler's awl. There was one who was shouting: \"Let\n      us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet.\"\n      This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the cross-belt\n      and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the cartridge-box\n      being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted: Public Order. There\n      were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions, few hats, no\n      cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this, all ages, all sorts of\n      faces, small, pale young men, and bronzed longshoremen. All were in haste;\n      and as they helped each other, they discussed the possible chances. That\n      they would receive succor about three o'clock in the morning\u2014that\n      they were sure of one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings\n      with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality. One would have\n      pronounced them brothers, but they did not know each other's names. Great\n      perils have this fine characteristic, that they bring to light the\n      fraternity of strangers. A fire had been lighted in the kitchen, and there\n      they were engaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks,\n      and all the brass table-ware of the establishment. In the midst of it all,\n      they drank. Caps and buckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with\n      glasses of wine. In the billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and\n      Gibelotte, variously modified by terror, which had stupefied one, rendered\n      another breathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old dish-cloths\n      and making lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired,\n      jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linen\n      with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.\n    \n      The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it had\n      finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no\n      longer paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again drew\n      near, with melancholy undulations.\n    \n      A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of the\n      bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.\n    \n      All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city,\n      through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousand\n      lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their\n      stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity\n      hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the glance fell into an abyss.\n      Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed windows, there all\n      radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased. The invisible police\n      of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere, and maintained order,\n      that is to say, night. The necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown\n      small numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiply every combatant by the\n      possibilities which that obscurity contains. At dusk, every window where a\n      candle was burning received a shot. The light was extinguished, sometimes\n      the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was stirring. There was nothing\n      but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; and in the streets, a sort of\n      sacred horror. Not even the long rows of windows and stores, the\n      indentations of the chimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflections\n      which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye\n      cast upward at that mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse\n      here and there, at intervals, of indistinct gleams which brought out\n      broken and eccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings, something\n      like the lights which go and come in ruins; it was at such points that the\n      barricades were situated. The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy,\n      and funereal, above which, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the\n      tower of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more\n      of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes\n      phantoms.\n    \n      All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters where\n      the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a few street\n      lanterns still burned, the aerial observer might have distinguished the\n      metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull rumble of artillery, and\n      the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to\n      minute; a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the\n      insurrection.\n    \n      While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the\n      same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events,\n      while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name of\n      principles, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, were\n      approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping and\n      throwing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last and\n      decisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatal\n      quarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that\n      wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and\n      opulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving\n      utterance to a dull roar.\n    \n      What are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections of\n      the soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean at\n      that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort of gulf\n      had opened again within him. He also was trembling, like Paris, on the\n      brink of an obscure and formidable revolution. A few hours had sufficed to\n      bring this about. His destiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered\n      with gloom. Of him also, as well as of Paris, it might have been said:\n      \"Two principles are face to face. The white angel and the black angel are\n      about to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss. Which of the two\n      will hurl the other over? Who will carry the day?\"\n    \n      People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature is\n      so constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l'Homme Arme\n      when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. There are\n      soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind. An obscure\n      street, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced an indescribable\n      contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient Paris, which is so\n      narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on\n      two posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city,\n      dimly lighted at mid-day, and is, so to speak, incapable of emotions\n      between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold their peace\n      like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that\n      street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there. How could he be\n      found there?\n    \n      While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice,\n      noticed in a confused way, Toussaint's stammering words as she said to\n      him: \"Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in Paris.\"\n      But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid no heed to\n      it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began to pace\n      from the door to the window and from the window to the door, growing ever\n      more serene.\n    \n      After panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where the\n      fusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and\n      thrust it forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head with his\n      right hand; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom has\n      condensed French irony, and which is evidently efficacious, since it has\n      already lasted half a century.\n    \n      The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in which\n      they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to\n      almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with a\n      smile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause.\n      Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. They reckoned on it.\n      With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one of the sources of\n      strength in the French combatant, they divided the day which was at hand\n      into three distinct phases. At six o'clock in the morning a regiment\n      \"which had been labored with,\" would turn; at noon, the insurrection of\n      all Paris; at sunset, revolution.\n    \n      \"The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing down\n      upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National Guard in\n      addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line, and the\n      standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you will be attacked. As\n      for the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-day it is not stirring.\n      There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope for. Neither from a faubourg\n      nor from a regiment. You are abandoned.\"\n    \n      Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had not been there\n      on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her chamber when\n      Toussaint had said:\n    \n      Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was.\n      Insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons. Insurrection,\n      which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain number of shots to fire\n      and a certain number of combatants to expend. An empty cartridge-box, a\n      man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has the army, it does not\n      count its men, and, as it has Vincennes, it does not count its shots.\n      Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men, and as many\n      arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus they are struggles of\n      one against a hundred, which always end in crushing the barricade; unless\n      the revolution, uprising suddenly, flings into the balance its flaming\n      archangel's sword. This does happen sometimes. Then everything rises, the\n      pavements begin to seethe, popular redoubts abound. Paris quivers\n      supremely, the quid divinum is given forth, a 10th of August is in the\n      air, a 29th of July is in the air, a wonderful light appears, the yawning\n      maw of force draws back, and the army, that lion, sees before it, erect\n      and tranquil, that prophet, France.\n    \n      \"Listen,\" suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, \"it seems\n      to me that Paris is waking up.\"\n    \n      These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it\n      was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this fever of\n      wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep masses\n      of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,\u2014all this,\n      taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste to stamp\n      out these beginnings of conflagration.\n    \n      Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as \"Abandoned\n      children,\" whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again on\n      the pavements of Paris.\n    \n      Everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment; a\n      thousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed masses set in\n      movement in the streets which were not visible, the intermittent gallop of\n      cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery on the march, the firing by squads,\n      and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth of Paris, the\n      smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs, indescribable and\n      vaguely terrible cries, lightnings of menace everywhere, the tocsin of\n      Saint-Merry, which now had the accents of a sob, the mildness of the\n      weather, the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds, the beauty of\n      the day, and the alarming silence of the houses.\n    \n      Because, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal, and for\n      the ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice\n      themselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth;\n      hence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at a\n      government or a regime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and we insist\n      upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, in particular,\n      the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie were combating, was not\n      precisely Louis Philippe. The majority of them, when talking freely, did\n      justice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution; no\n      one hated him. But they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in\n      Louis Philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in Charles X.; and\n      that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty in France, was,\n      as we have explained, the usurpation of man over man, and of privilege\n      over right in the entire universe. Paris without a king has as result the\n      world without despots. This is the manner in which they reasoned. Their\n      aim was distant no doubt, vague perhaps, and it retreated in the face of\n      their efforts; but it was great.\n    \n      Enjolras alone was not struck. When he had no longer any weapon, he\n      reached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm\n      or other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps of four swords; one\n      more than Francois I. at Marignan. Homer says: \"Diomedes cuts the throat\n      of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy Arisba; Euryalus, son of\n      Mecistaeus, exterminates Dresos and Opheltios, Esepius, and that Pedasus\n      whom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blameless Bucolion; Ulysses\n      overthrows Pidytes of Percosius; Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypaetes,\n      Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon. Meganthios\n      dies under the blows of Euripylus' pike. Agamemnon, king of the heroes,\n      flings to earth Elatos, born in the rocky city which is laved by the\n      sounding river Satnois.\" In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian attacks\n      the giant marquis Swantibore with a cobbler's shoulder-stick of fire, and\n      the latter defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucks\n      up by the roots. Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes of\n      Bretagne and Bourbon, armed, emblazoned and crested in war-like guise, on\n      horseback and approaching each other, their battle-axes in hand, masked\n      with iron, gloved with iron, booted with iron, the one caparisoned in\n      ermine, the other draped in azure: Bretagne with his lion between the two\n      horns of his crown, Bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his\n      visor. But, in order to be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon,\n      the ducal morion, to have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame,\n      or, like Phyles, father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a\n      good suit of mail, a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it suffices\n      to give one's life for a conviction or a loyalty. This ingenuous little\n      soldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who prowls with his\n      clasp-knife by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourg\n      garden, this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book, a\n      blond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,\u2014take both of them,\n      breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face in the\n      Carrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and let the one\n      fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and let both of them\n      imagine that they are fighting for their country; the struggle will be\n      colossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones in\n      conflict will produce in that grand epic field where humanity is striving,\n      will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon, King of Lycia, tiger-filled,\n      crushing in his embrace the immense body of Ajax, equal to the gods.\n    \n      Paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this without\n      metaphor. How, and in what manner? Day and night. With what object? With\n      no object. With what intention? With no intention. Why? For no reason. By\n      means of what organ? By means of its intestine. What is its intestine? The\n      sewer.\n    \n      So far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, to\n      transport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below the last bridge.\n    \n      As for France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains one\n      twenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano being\n      the richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the loss on the\n      part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which France\n      annually rejects. These twenty-five millions, employed in assistance and\n      enjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. The city spends them in\n      sewers. So that we may say that Paris's great prodigality, its wonderful\n      festival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, its stream of gold from full hands,\n      its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence, is its sewer system.\n    \n      Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is a\n      spendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arranged\n      capitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that metropolis\n      of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of impulse and of\n      effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that nation-city, that\n      hive of the future, that marvellous combination of Babylon and Corinth,\n      would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his shoulders, from the point of\n      view which we have just indicated.\n    \n      Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.\n    \n      Moreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste, Paris\n      is itself an imitator.\n    \n      Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to intelligent\n      towns.\n    \n      For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have\n      just explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Paris of\n      sewers; which has its streets, its cross-roads, its squares, its\n      blind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is of mire and\n      minus the human form.\n    \n      For nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where there is\n      everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and, if Paris\n      contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might, Sparta, the\n      city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, it also contains Lutetia,\n      the city of mud.\n    \n      However, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink of\n      Paris realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized in humanity\n      by some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, grandiose vileness.\n    \n      The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, would\n      present the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no more\n      partitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six leagues\n      round about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not to mention its\n      catacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mention the inextricable\n      trellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast tubular system for\n      the distribution of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains, the\n      sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-work under the two banks; a\n      labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding thread.\n    \n      There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product to which\n      Paris has given birth.\n    \n      Let the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterranean\n      net-work of sewers, from a bird's eye view, will outline on the banks a\n      species of large branch grafted on the river. On the right bank, the belt\n      sewer will form the trunk of this branch, the secondary ducts will form\n      the branches, and those without exit the twigs.\n    \n      The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. The Germoniae58 narrated\n      Rome. The sewer of Paris has been an ancient and formidable thing. It has\n      been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum. Crime, intelligence, social\n      protest, liberty of conscience, thought, theft, all that human laws\n      persecute or have persecuted, is hidden in that hole; the maillotins in\n      the fourteenth century, the tire-laine of the fifteenth, the Huguenots in\n      the sixteenth, Morin's illuminated in the seventeenth, the chauffeurs\n      [brigands] in the eighteenth. A hundred years ago, the nocturnal blow of\n      the dagger emerged thence, the pickpocket in danger slipped thither; the\n      forest had its cave, Paris had its sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic picareria,\n      accepted the sewer as the adjunct of the Cour des Miracles, and at\n      evening, it returned thither, fierce and sly, through the Maubuee outlet,\n      as into a bed-chamber.\n    \n      The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of all\n      attempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, social philosophy\n      there beholds a residuum.\n    \n      The sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the sixteenth\n      century, Henri II. attempted a bore, which failed. Not a hundred years\n      ago, the cess-pool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself, and\n      fared as best it might.\n    \n      Such was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision,\n      and to gropings. It was tolerably stupid for a long time. Later on, '89\n      showed how understanding comes to cities. But in the good, old times, the\n      capital had not much head. It did not know how to manage its own affairs\n      either morally or materially, and could not sweep out filth any better\n      than it could abuses. Everything presented an obstacle, everything raised\n      a question. The sewer, for example, was refractory to every itinerary. One\n      could no more find one's bearings in the sewer than one could understand\n      one's position in the city; above the unintelligible, below the\n      inextricable; beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned the confusion\n      of caverns; Daedalus backed up Babel.\n    \n      Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though this\n      misunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. There\n      occurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, that\n      stomach of civilization digested badly, the cess-pool flowed back into the\n      throat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth. These\n      resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points; they were\n      warnings; very badly accepted, however; the city waxed indignant at the\n      audacity of its mire, and did not admit that the filth should return.\n      Drive it out better.\n    \n      The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians of the\n      age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des Victoires,\n      where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue Saint-Honore by\n      the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Elysees, the Rue Saint-Florentin\n      through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue Pierre-a-Poisson through the\n      sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt, through the sewer of the\n      Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through the sewer of the Rue de\n      Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue des Champs-Elysees to the height of\n      thirty-five centimetres; and, to the South, through the vent of the Seine,\n      performing its functions in inverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine,\n      the Rue de l'Echaude, and the Rue des Marais, where it stopped at a\n      distance of one hundred and nine metres, a few paces distant from the\n      house in which Racine had lived, respecting, in the seventeenth century,\n      the poet more than the King. It attained its maximum depth in the Rue\n      Saint-Pierre, where it rose to the height of three feet above the\n      flag-stones of the water-spout, and its maximum length in the Rue\n      Saint-Sabin, where it spread out over a stretch two hundred and\n      thirty-eight metres in length.\n    \n      At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a\n      mysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case its\n      evil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confused\n      way, that she had under her a terrible cavern. People talked of it as of\n      that monstrous bed of Thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet\n      in length, and which might have served Behemoth for a bathtub. The great\n      boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well-known\n      points. We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger's carts, from\n      the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis de Crequi,\n      discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As for cleaning out,\u2014that\n      function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than\n      swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer, and called it the\n      Gemoniae; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the Polypus-Hole. Science\n      and superstition were in accord, in horror. The Polypus hole was no less\n      repugnant to hygiene than to legend. The goblin was developed under the\n      fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets had\n      been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie; Fagon attributed the\n      redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great hiatus of the sewer of\n      the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis,\n      almost opposite the sign of the Gallant Messenger. The mouth of the sewer\n      of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had\n      their source there; with its grating of iron, with points simulating a row\n      of teeth, it was like a dragon's maw in that fatal street, breathing forth\n      hell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink\n      with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. The sewer\n      had no bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea of exploring these\n      leprous regions did not even occur to the police. To try that unknown\n      thing, to cast the plummet into that shadow, to set out on a voyage of\n      discovery in that abyss\u2014who would have dared? It was alarming.\n      Nevertheless, some one did present himself. The cess-pool had its\n      Christopher Columbus.\n    \n      One day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperor\n      made in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decres or Cretet or\n      other, came to the master's intimate levee. In the Carrousel there was\n      audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of the\n      great Republic, and of the great Empire; then Napoleon's door was blocked\n      with heroes; men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the Adige, and from\n      the Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau, of Hoche, of\n      Kleber; the aerostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of Mayence, the\n      pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had looked down upon,\n      artillerists whom Junot's cannon-ball had spattered with mud, cuirassiers\n      who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the Zuyderzee; some\n      had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi, others had accompanied\n      Murat in the trenches of Mantua, others had preceded Lannes in the hollow\n      road of Montebello. The whole army of that day was present there, in the\n      court-yard of the Tuileries, represented by a squadron or a platoon, and\n      guarding Napoleon in repose; and that was the splendid epoch when the\n      grand army had Marengo behind it and Austerlitz before it.\u2014\"Sire,\"\n      said the Minister of the Interior to Napoleon, \"yesterday I saw the most\n      intrepid man in your Empire.\"\u2014\"What man is that?\" said the Emperor\n      brusquely, \"and what has he done?\"\u2014\"He wants to do something, Sire.\"\u2014\"What\n      is it?\"\u2014\"To visit the sewers of Paris.\"\n    \n      Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point of\n      separation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered\n      upon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated the limits\n      where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting the\n      subterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark of the\n      sixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of the\n      seventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old Rue\n      Vielle-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork of the\n      eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal, walled and\n      vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that of\n      1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer,\n      which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water of\n      Menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, an\n      advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet\n      de chambre to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.\n    \n      The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lasted seven\n      years, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew, directed, and\n      completed considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the arch of the Ponceau,\n      and, everywhere creating new lines, he pushed the sewer, in 1809, under\n      the Rue Saint-Denis as far as the fountain of the Innocents; in 1810,\n      under the Rue Froidmanteau and under the Salpetriere; in 1811 under the\n      Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Peres, under the Rue du Mail, under the Rue de\n      l'Echarpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812, under the Rue de la Paix, and\n      under the Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin. At the same time, he had the whole net-work\n      disinfected and rendered healthful. In the second year of his work,\n      Bruneseau engaged the assistance of his son-in-law Nargaud.\n    \n      Tortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected by gullies,\n      jolted by eccentric elbows, mounting and descending illogically, fetid,\n      wild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with cicatrices on its pavements and\n      scars on its walls, terrible,\u2014such was, retrospectively viewed, the\n      antique sewer of Paris. Ramifications in every direction, crossings, of\n      trenches, branches, goose-feet, stars, as in military mines, coecum, blind\n      alleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, pestiferous pools, scabby sweats, on\n      the walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness; nothing could equal\n      the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive apparatus of Babylon, a\n      cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, a titanic mole-burrow, where the\n      mind seems to behold that enormous blind mole, the past, prowling through\n      the shadows, in the filth which has been splendor.\n    \n      To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes the\n      ideal of what is understood in England by the word \"respectable.\" It is\n      proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost say as\n      though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who has become a\n      councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. The mire there\n      comports itself with decency. At first, one might readily mistake it for\n      one of those subterranean corridors, which were so common in former days,\n      and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, in those good old times,\n      \"when the people loved their kings.\" The present sewer is a beautiful\n      sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical rectilinear alexandrine\n      which, driven out of poetry, appears to have taken refuge in architecture,\n      seems mingled with all the stones of that long, dark and whitish vault;\n      each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves as pattern even in the\n      sewer. However, if the geometrical line is in place anywhere, it is\n      certainly in the drainage trench of a great city. There, everything should\n      be subordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a\n      certain official aspect. The very police reports, of which it sometimes\n      forms the subject, no longer are wanting in respect towards it. The words\n      which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and\n      dignified. What used to be called a gut is now called a gallery; what used\n      to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon would no\n      longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging. This net-work\n      of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming in\n      greater numbers than ever; from time to time, an aged and veteran rat\n      risks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; but\n      even these vermin grow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterranean\n      palace. The cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity.\n      The rain, which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it.\n      Nevertheless, do not trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabit\n      it. It is more hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of police\n      and the commission of health have done their best. But, in spite of all\n      the processes of disinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor like\n      Tartuffe after confession.\n    \n      Let us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homage\n      which the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view,\n      Tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it is certain\n      that the sewers of Paris have been improved.\n    \n      The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last ten\n      centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a\n      termination, any more than they have been able to finish Paris. The sewer,\n      in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris. Within\n      the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand\n      antennae, which expands below as the city expands above. Every time that\n      the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. The old monarchy\n      had constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundred metres of sewers;\n      that was where Paris stood in this respect on the first of January, 1806.\n      Beginning with this epoch, of which we shall shortly speak, the work was\n      usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted; Napoleon built\u2014the\n      figures are curious\u2014four thousand eight hundred and four metres;\n      Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred and nine; Charles X., ten\n      thousand eight hundred and thirty-six; Louis-Philippe, eighty-nine\n      thousand and twenty; the Republic of 1848, twenty-three thousand three\n      hundred and eighty-one; the present government, seventy thousand five\n      hundred; in all, at the present time, two hundred and twenty-six thousand\n      six hundred and ten metres; sixty leagues of sewers; the enormous entrails\n      of Paris. An obscure ramification ever at work; a construction which is\n      immense and ignored.\n    \n      As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day more\n      than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. It is\n      difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which\n      have been required to bring this cess-pool to the point of relative\n      perfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty that the\n      ancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years of the\n      eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded in\n      perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806. All\n      sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to the soil,\n      others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population of\n      Paris. Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to the\n      pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothing more\n      difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon\n      which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called Paris; as\n      soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this\n      stretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances abound. There are liquid\n      clays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft and deep quagmires which\n      special science calls moutardes.59 The pick advances laboriously\n      through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of\n      clay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, the\n      contemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenly\n      bursts through a vault that has been begun, and inundates the laborers; or\n      a layer of marl is laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of a cataract,\n      breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass. Quite recently, at\n      Villette, when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the\n      Saint-Martin canal without interrupting navigation or emptying the canal,\n      a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal, water suddenly became\n      abundant in the subterranean tunnel, which was beyond the power of the\n      pumping engines; it was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure\n      which had been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin, and it was\n      not without great difficulty that it was stopped up. Elsewhere near the\n      Seine, and even at a considerable distance from the river, as for\n      instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and Lumiere Passage, quicksands are\n      encountered in which one sticks fast, and in which a man sinks visibly.\n      Add suffocation by miasmas, burial by slides, and sudden crumbling of the\n      earth. Add the typhus, with which the workmen become slowly impregnated.\n      In our own day, after having excavated the gallery of Clichy, with a\n      banquette to receive the principal water-conduit of Ourcq, a piece of work\n      which was executed in a trench ten metres deep; after having, in the midst\n      of land-slides, and with the aid of excavations often putrid, and of\n      shoring up, vaulted the Bievre from the Boulevard de l'Hopital, as far as\n      the Seine; after having, in order to deliver Paris from the floods of\n      Montmartre and in order to provide an outlet for that river-like pool nine\n      hectares in extent, which crouched near the Barriere des Martyrs, after\n      having, let us state, constructed the line of sewers from the Barriere\n      Blanche to the road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day and\n      night, at a depth of eleven metres; after having\u2014a thing heretofore\n      unseen\u2014made a subterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a\n      trench, six metres below the surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died.\n      After having vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the\n      city, from the Rue Traversiere-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l'Ourcine,\n      after having freed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of\n      rain by means of the branch of the Arbalete, after having built the\n      Saint-Georges sewer, on rock and concrete in the fluid sands, after having\n      directed the formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in\n      the Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the engineer died. There are no\n      bulletins for such acts of bravery as these, which are more useful,\n      nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle.\n    \n      The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day.\n      Bruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required to bring\n      about the vast reconstruction which took place later on. It is surprising\n      to say, for example, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer, called the\n      Grand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky, in\n      the Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the city of Paris found in\n      its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty francs and six\n      centimes required for covering this mass of filth. The three absorbing\n      wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mande, with their discharging\n      mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and their depuratory branches,\n      only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of Paris has been made over\n      anew, and, as we have said, it has been extended more than tenfold within\n      the last quarter of a century.\n    \n      Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in\n      1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1st of\n      January, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. Between 1806\n      and 1831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred and fifty\n      metres annually, afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of\n      galleries were constructed every year, in masonry, of small stones, with\n      hydraulic mortar which hardens under water, on a cement foundation. At two\n      hundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of Paris' sewers of the\n      present day represent forty-eight millions.\n    \n      In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the\n      beginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that\n      immense question: the sewers of Paris.\n    \n      Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air.\n      The sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, but\n      already sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green clay\n      situated between the chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may be\n      represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference; a\n      multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, the\n      Marne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the Loire\n      in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water is\n      healthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the earth;\n      the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All the miasms of\n      the cess-pool are mingled with the breath of the city; hence this bad\n      breath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been scientifically\n      proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. In a given time,\n      with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected, and as light\n      increases, the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air;\n      that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows, that by \"washing the\n      sewer\" we mean: the restitution of the filth to the earth; the return to\n      the soil of dung and of manure to the fields. Through this simple act, the\n      entire social community will experience a diminution of misery and an\n      augmentation of health. At the present hour, the radiation of diseases\n      from Paris extends to fifty leagues around the Louvre, taken as the hub of\n      this pestilential wheel.\n    \n      We might say that, for ten centuries, the cess-pool has been the disease\n      of Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. The\n      popular instinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation of sewermen\n      was formerly almost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to the people, as\n      the occupation of knacker, which was so long held in horror and handed\n      over to the executioner. High wages were necessary to induce a mason to\n      disappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the cess-pool cleaner\n      hesitated to plunge into it; it was said, in proverbial form: \"to descend\n      into the sewer is to enter the grave;\" and all sorts of hideous legends,\n      as we have said, covered this colossal sink with terror; a dread sink-hole\n      which bears the traces of the revolutions of the globe as of the\n      revolutions of man, and where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysms\n      from the shells of the Deluge to the rag of Marat.\n    \n      Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea. As in the ocean, the\n      diver may disappear there.\n    \n      An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret trap-door of\n      Paris; to quit that street where death was on every side, for that sort of\n      sepulchre where there was life, was a strange instant. He remained for\n      several seconds as though bewildered; listening, stupefied. The waste-trap\n      of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him. Celestial goodness had, in a\n      manner, captured him by treachery. Adorable ambuscades of providence!\n    \n      He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; that if\n      he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope, he would\n      arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on the Seine\n      between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he would\n      make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in\n      Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection of\n      streets. Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men emerge\n      from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a call to arms of the\n      neighboring post of guards. Thus they would be seized before they had even\n      got out. It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confide\n      themselves to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence for the\n      outcome.\n    \n      The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of the streets\n      which lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred\n      streets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy\n      branches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing at that\n      epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of eleven leagues. We\n      have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the special activity\n      of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty leagues in extent.\n    \n      By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. The gloom\n      which enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked in an enigma. This\n      aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion. It\n      is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows. Jean Valjean\n      was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it. In\n      this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last. How was he to\n      get out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time? would that\n      colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, allow itself to be\n      penetrated and pierced? should he there encounter some unexpected knot in\n      the darkness? should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable?\n      would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger? should they end by\n      both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that\n      night? He did not know. He put all these questions to himself without\n      replying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice. Like the\n      prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.\n    \n      It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge which the\n      soil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its water-sheds into\n      the Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridge\n      which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious\n      line. The culminating point, which is the point of separation of the\n      currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte, in\n      the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the Montmartre sewer,\n      near the Halles. It was this culminating point that Jean Valjean had\n      reached. He was directing his course towards the belt sewer; he was on the\n      right path. But he did not know it.\n    \n      At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the\n      Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades had\n      suppressed circulation, and that he was entering beneath the living and\n      normal Paris. Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant\n      but continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles.\n    \n      On the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had been ordered.\n      It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge, and\n      Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while General Bugeaud swept\n      public Paris; a double and connected operation which exacted a double\n      strategy on the part of the public force, represented above by the army\n      and below by the police. Three squads of agents and sewermen explored the\n      subterranean drain of Paris, the first on the right bank, the second on\n      the left bank, the third in the city. The agents of police were armed with\n      carabines, with bludgeons, swords and poignards.\n    \n      This point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to\n      Paris from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated as \"the house\n      of Francois I.\" A guard house is situated close at hand.\n    \n      The hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, had, in its\n      turn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. The coachman,\n      foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses' muzzles in the bag of\n      oats which is damp at the bottom, and which is so familiar to Parisians,\n      to whom, be it said in parenthesis, the Government sometimes applies it.\n      The rare passers-by on the Pont de Jena turned their heads, before they\n      pursued their way, to take a momentary glance at these two motionless\n      items in the landscape, the man on the shore, the carriage on the quay.\n    \n      It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that the\n      belt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the other\n      towards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterranean\n      girdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, it must\n      be remembered, nothing else than the old brook of Menilmontant,\n      terminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, that is to say, at its\n      ancient point of departure which was its source, at the foot of the knoll\n      of Menilmontant. There is no direct communication with the branch which\n      collects the waters of Paris beginning with the Quartier Popincourt, and\n      which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer above the ancient Isle\n      Louviers. This branch, which completes the collecting sewer, is separated\n      from it, under the Rue Menilmontant itself, by a pile which marks the\n      dividing point of the waters, between upstream and downstream. If Jean\n      Valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived, after a thousand\n      efforts, and broken down with fatigue, and in an expiring condition, in\n      the gloom, at a wall. He would have been lost.\n    \n      This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we are\n      illuminating for the reader Jean Valjean's subterranean march, Jean\n      Valjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the city he\n      was traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of the\n      pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him\n      that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day would\n      soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having become\n      intermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, he\n      concluded that he was no longer under central Paris, and that he was\n      approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outer boulevards,\n      or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses and streets, the\n      sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean.\n      Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in the dark.\n    \n      This melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, was also\n      possible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.\n    \n      Before the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drain of\n      Paris was subject to these sudden slides.\n    \n      The arch was closed by a heavy grating, and the grating, which, to all\n      appearance, rarely swung on its rusty hinges, was clamped to its stone\n      jamb by a thick lock, which, red with rust, seemed like an enormous brick.\n      The keyhole could be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk in the iron\n      staple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was one of those prison\n      locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing.\n    \n      Beyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, the shore,\n      very narrow but sufficient for escape. The distant quays, Paris, that gulf\n      in which one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty. On the\n      right, down stream, the bridge of Jena was discernible, on the left,\n      upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place would have been a\n      propitious one in which to await the night and to escape. It was one of\n      the most solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces the\n      Grand-Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the\n      grating.\n    \n      \"After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow to\n      stop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there,\n      and it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by straw, to pick\n      up the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through the sewer. Who?\n      Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? The police are full of\n      cleverness. The sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you. Such a find\n      is a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people make use of the sewers\n      for their affairs, while the river belongs to everybody. The river is the\n      true grave. At the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets at\n      Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for that? It's carrion! Who killed\n      that man? Paris. And justice makes no inquiries. You have done well.\"\n    \n      \"It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. And to think\n      that there is not a hussy in Paris who would not have been delighted to\n      make this wretch happy! A scamp who, instead of amusing himself and\n      enjoying life, went off to fight and get himself shot down like a brute!\n      And for whom? Why? For the Republic! Instead of going to dance at the\n      Chaumiere, as it is the duty of young folks to do! What's the use of being\n      twenty years old? The Republic, a cursed pretty folly! Poor mothers, beget\n      fine boys, do! Come, he is dead. That will make two funerals under the\n      same carriage gate. So you have got yourself arranged like this for the\n      sake of General Lamarque's handsome eyes! What had that General Lamarque\n      done to you? A slasher! A chatter-box! To get oneself killed for a dead\n      man! If that isn't enough to drive any one mad! Just think of it! At\n      twenty! And without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not\n      leaving something behind him! That's the way poor, good old fellows are\n      forced to die alone, now-adays. Perish in your corner, owl! Well, after\n      all, so much the better, that is what I was hoping for, this will kill me\n      on the spot. I am too old, I am a hundred years old, I am a hundred\n      thousand years old, I ought, by rights, to have been dead long ago. This\n      blow puts an end to it. So all is over, what happiness! What is the good\n      of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs? You are wasting\n      your trouble, you fool of a doctor! Come, he's dead, completely dead. I\n      know all about it, I am dead myself too. He hasn't done things by half.\n      Yes, this age is infamous, infamous and that's what I think of you, of\n      your ideas, of your systems, of your masters, of your oracles, of your\n      doctors, of your scape-graces of writers, of your rascally philosophers,\n      and of all the revolutions which, for the last sixty years, have been\n      frightening the flocks of crows in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless in\n      getting yourself killed like this, I shall not even grieve over your\n      death, do you understand, you assassin?\"\n    \n      However, apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch,\n      Boulatruelle put things together and made calculations. This man did not\n      belong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot, evidently.\n      No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil at that hour. He had\n      walked all night. Whence came he? Not from a very great distance; for he\n      had neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why was he in\n      these woods? why was he there at such an hour? what had he come there for?\n    \n      \"By the deuce,\" said Boulatruelle, \"I'll find him again. I'll discover the\n      parish of that parishioner. This prowler of Patron-Minette has a reason,\n      and I'll know it. People can't have secrets in my forest if I don't have a\n      finger in the pie.\"\n    \n      \"How pretty she is! how pretty she is! She's a Greuze. So you are going to\n      have that all to yourself, you scamp! Ah! my rogue, you are getting off\n      nicely with me, you are happy; if I were not fifteen years too old, we\n      would fight with swords to see which of us should have her. Come now! I am\n      in love with you, mademoiselle. It's perfectly simple. It is your right.\n      You are in the right. Ah! what a sweet, charming little wedding this will\n      make! Our parish is Saint-Denis du Saint Sacrament, but I will get a\n      dispensation so that you can be married at Saint-Paul. The church is\n      better. It was built by the Jesuits. It is more coquettish. It is opposite\n      the fountain of Cardinal de Birague. The masterpiece of Jesuit\n      architecture is at Namur. It is called Saint-Loup. You must go there after\n      you are married. It is worth the journey. Mademoiselle, I am quite of your\n      mind, I think girls ought to marry; that is what they are made for. There\n      is a certain Sainte-Catherine whom I should always like to see uncoiffed.62 It's a\n      fine thing to remain a spinster, but it is chilly. The Bible says:\n      Multiply. In order to save the people, Jeanne d'Arc is needed; but in\n      order to make people, what is needed is Mother Goose. So, marry, my\n      beauties. I really do not see the use in remaining a spinster! I know that\n      they have their chapel apart in the church, and that they fall back on the\n      Society of the Virgin; but, sapristi, a handsome husband, a fine fellow,\n      and at the expiration of a year, a big, blond brat who nurses lustily, and\n      who has fine rolls of fat on his thighs, and who musses up your breast in\n      handfuls with his little rosy paws, laughing the while like the dawn,\u2014that's\n      better than holding a candle at vespers, and chanting Turris eburnea!\"\n    \n      The reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating a lengthy\n      explanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had been\n      able, thanks to his first escape of a few days' duration, to come to Paris\n      and to withdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, the sum earned by\n      him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, at Montreuil-sur-Mer; and that\n      fearing that he might be recaptured,\u2014which eventually happened\u2014he\n      had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of Montfermeil, in the\n      locality known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six hundred and thirty\n      thousand francs, all in bank-bills, was not very bulky, and was contained\n      in a box; only, in order to preserve the box from dampness, he had placed\n      it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings. In the same coffer he had\n      placed his other treasures, the Bishop's candlesticks. It will be\n      remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his\n      escape from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The man seen one evening for the first time\n      by Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean. Later on, every time that Jean Valjean\n      needed money, he went to get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences\n      which we have mentioned. He had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a\n      hiding-place known to himself alone. When he beheld Marius convalescent,\n      feeling that the hour was at hand, when that money might prove of service,\n      he had gone to get it; it was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in the\n      woods, but on this occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening.\n      Boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe.\n    \n      \"You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do not know how to organize\n      a day of enjoyment in this age,\" he exclaimed. \"Your nineteenth century is\n      weak. It lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it ignores the noble. In\n      everything it is clean-shaven. Your third estate is insipid, colorless,\n      odorless, and shapeless. The dreams of your bourgeois who set up, as they\n      express it: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, violet, ebony and calico.\n      Make way! Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marrying Mademoiselle\n      Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness and splendor. A louis d'or has been stuck to a\n      candle. There's the epoch for you. My demand is that I may flee from it\n      beyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict that all was lost, from the\n      day when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Leon, Duc de Chabot, Duc de\n      Montbazon, Marquis de Sonbise, Vicomte de Thouars, peer of France, go to\n      Longchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits. In this century, men\n      attend to business, they gamble on 'Change, they win money, they are\n      stingy. People take care of their surfaces and varnish them; every one is\n      dressed as though just out of a band-box, washed, soaped, scraped, shaved,\n      combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed, brushed, cleaned on the outside,\n      irreproachable, polished as a pebble, discreet, neat, and at the same\n      time, death of my life, in the depths of their consciences they have\n      dung-heaps and cesspools that are enough to make a cow-herd who blows his\n      nose in his fingers, recoil. I grant to this age the device: 'Dirty\n      Cleanliness.' Don't be vexed, Marius, give me permission to speak; I say\n      no evil of the people as you see, I am always harping on your people, but\n      do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie. I\n      belong to it. He who loves well lashes well. Thereupon, I say plainly,\n      that now-a-days people marry, but that they no longer know how to marry.\n      Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of the ancient manners. I regret\n      everything about them, their elegance, their chivalry, those courteous and\n      delicate ways, that joyous luxury which every one possessed, music forming\n      part of the wedding, a symphony above stairs, a beating of drums below\n      stairs, the dances, the joyous faces round the table, the fine-spun\n      gallant compliments, the songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, the\n      devil's own row, the huge knots of ribbon. I regret the bride's garter.\n      The bride's garter is cousin to the girdle of Venus. On what does the war\n      of Troy turn? On Helen's garter, parbleu! Why did they fight, why did\n      Diomed the divine break over the head of Meriones that great brazen helmet\n      of ten points? why did Achilles and Hector hew each other up with vast\n      blows of their lances? Because Helen allowed Paris to take her garter.\n      With Cosette's garter, Homer would construct the Iliad. He would put in\n      his poem, a loquacious old fellow, like me, and he would call him Nestor.\n      My friends, in bygone days, in those amiable days of yore, people married\n      wisely; they had a good contract, and then they had a good carouse. As\n      soon as Cujas had taken his departure, Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! the\n      stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants to\n      have its wedding also. People supped well, and had at table a beautiful\n      neighbor without a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately\n      concealed. Oh! the large laughing mouths, and how gay we were in those\n      days! youth was a bouquet; every young man terminated in a branch of\n      lilacs or a tuft of roses; whether he was a shepherd or a warrior; and if,\n      by chance, one was a captain of dragoons, one found means to call oneself\n      Florian. People thought much of looking well. They embroidered and tinted\n      themselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a Marquis had the air of\n      a precious stone. People had no straps to their boots, they had no boots.\n      They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty,\n      coquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their\n      sides. The humming-bird has beak and claws. That was the day of the\n      Galland Indies. One of the sides of that century was delicate, the other\n      was magnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves.\n      To-day, people are serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise is\n      a prude; your century is unfortunate. People would drive away the Graces\n      as being too low in the neck. Alas! beauty is concealed as though it were\n      ugliness. Since the revolution, everything, including the ballet-dancers,\n      has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave; your rigadoons\n      are doctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. People would be greatly\n      annoyed if they did not carry their chins in their cravats. The ideal of\n      an urchin of twenty when he marries, is to resemble M. Royer-Collard. And\n      do you know what one arrives at with that majesty? at being petty. Learn\n      this: joy is not only joyous; it is great. But be in love gayly then, what\n      the deuce! marry, when you marry, with fever and giddiness, and tumult,\n      and the uproar of happiness! Be grave in church, well and good. But, as\n      soon as the mass is finished, sarpejou! you must make a dream whirl around\n      the bride. A marriage should be royal and chimerical; it should promenade\n      its ceremony from the cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I\n      have a horror of a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that\n      one day, at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Games\n      and Laughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every recently\n      made bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. Profit by that unique\n      minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles,\n      even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the\n      frogs. Don't economize on the nuptials, do not prune them of their\n      splendors; don't scrimp on the day when you beam. The wedding is not the\n      housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy, it would be gallant,\n      violins would be heard under the trees. Here is my programme: sky-blue and\n      silver. I would mingle with the festival the rural divinities, I would\n      convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The nuptials of Amphitrite, a rosy\n      cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked, an Academician\n      offering quatrains to the goddess, a chariot drawn by marine monsters.\n    \n      They went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosette\n      and Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. Marius, still\n      separated from his betrothed according to usage, did not come until the\n      second. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue des\n      Filles-du-Calvaire, became entangled in a long procession of vehicles\n      which formed an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, and from\n      the Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard. In spite\n      of the fact that it was raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew, Pantaloon and\n      Clown persisted. In the good humor of that winter of 1833, Paris had\n      disguised itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays are no longer to be seen\n      now-a-days. Everything which exists being a scattered Carnival, there is\n      no longer any Carnival.\n    \n      The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with\n      curious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the\n      theatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they stared\n      at that procession\u2014peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps,\u2014of\n      vehicles of every description, citadines, tapissieres, carioles,\n      cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other by the\n      police regulations, and locked into rails, as it were. Any one in these\n      vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle. Police-sergeants\n      maintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two interminable parallel\n      files, moving in contrary directions, and saw to it that nothing\n      interfered with that double current, those two brooks of carriages,\n      flowing, the one down stream, the other up stream, the one towards the\n      Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin, the other towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The\n      carriages of the peers of France and of the Ambassadors, emblazoned with\n      coats of arms, held the middle of the way, going and coming freely.\n      Certain joyous and magnificent trains, notably that of the Boeuf Gras, had\n      the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris, England cracked her whip;\n      Lord Seymour's post-chaise, harassed by a nickname from the populace,\n      passed with great noise.\n    \n      These carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads of maskers\n      are very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on a Shrove Tuesday,\n      or at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, and people would say:\n      \"There's something behind that. Probably the ministry is about to undergo\n      a change.\" A pile of Cassandras, Harlequins and Columbines, jolted along\n      high above the passers-by, all possible grotesquenesses, from the Turk to\n      the savage, Hercules supporting Marquises, fishwives who would have made\n      Rabelais stop up his ears just as the Maenads made Aristophanes drop his\n      eyes, tow wigs, pink tights, dandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer,\n      three-cornered hats of Janot tormented with a butterfly, shouts directed\n      at pedestrians, fists on hips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, immodesty\n      unchained; a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with\n      flowers; this is what that institution was like.\n    \n      A laughter that is too cynical to be frank. In truth, this laughter is\n      suspicious. This laughter has a mission. It is charged with proving the\n      Carnival to the Parisians.\n    \n      It certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of\n      gayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be\n      enticed, that the system of spying, and serving as caryatids to\n      prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, that the\n      crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, half\n      dung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling and laughing, that they\n      should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, that there\n      would be no festival for the populace, did not the police promenade in\n      their midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy. But what can be\n      done about it? These be-ribboned and be-flowered tumbrils of mire are\n      insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public. The laughter of all\n      is the accomplice of universal degradation. Certain unhealthy festivals\n      disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace. And populaces,\n      like tyrants, require buffoons. The King has Roquelaure, the populace has\n      the Merry-Andrew. Paris is a great, mad city on every occasion that it is\n      a great sublime city. There the Carnival forms part of politics. Paris,\u2014let\n      us confess it\u2014willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy. She\n      only demands of her masters\u2014when she has masters\u2014one thing:\n      \"Paint me the mud.\" Rome was of the same mind. She loved Nero. Nero was a\n      titanic lighterman.\n    \n      \"I'm willing that they should cut my throat, and I'm ready to swear that I\n      never said either you, thou, or I, in my life, if I don't know that\n      Parisian.\" [pantinois.]\n    \n      \"Paris in Pantin to-day.\"\n    \n      The first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What was the\n      Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette's marriage and of that\n      which it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys, compared to\n      entrance into the void?\n    \n      Was there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had\n      presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really a\n      chrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?\n    \n      Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There are\n      streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to which no\n      one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of those houses.\n    \n      There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue\n      Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to\n      change villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have proved\n      embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day or two,\n      at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which resembled\n      the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible. This costumer\n      was called \"the Changer\"; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name\n      and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The rags\n      with which he tricked out people were almost probable. He had specialties\n      and categories; on each nail of his shop hung a social status, threadbare\n      and worn; here the suit of a magistrate, there the outfit of a Cur\u00e9,\n      beyond the outfit of a banker, in one corner the costume of a retired\n      military man, elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters, and further\n      on the dress of a statesman.\n    \n      This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in\n      Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into which\n      roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room,\n      deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part which he\n      wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending the stairs\n      once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the clothes\n      were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the thieves with\n      everything, was never robbed. There was one inconvenience about these\n      clothes, they \"did not fit\"; not having been made for those who wore them,\n      they were too tight for one, too loose for another and did not adjust\n      themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the\n      human average was ill at his ease in the Changer's costumes. It was\n      necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean. The changer\n      had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species\n      from the first rascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin,\n      neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult\n      and from which the Changer's clients extricated themselves as best they\n      might. So much the worse for the exceptions! The suit of the statesman,\n      for instance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would have\n      been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The costume of a\n      statesman was designated as follows in the Changer's catalogue; we copy:\n    \n      If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, he\n      would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom Basque\n      had just shown in, the statesman's suit borrowed from the\n      pick-me-down-that shop of the Changer.\n    \n      Thenardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius'\n      neighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he had\n      formerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor young\n      man named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, without\n      knowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.\n    \n      \"I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pas\n      de Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice, and\n      who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status and\n      rehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the full force of\n      the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he made the\n      fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune was concerned he\n      made that also, but as a secondary matter, and in some sort, by accident.\n      He was the foster-father of the poor. He founded hospitals, opened\n      schools, visited the sick, dowered young girls, supported widows, and\n      adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of the country. He refused\n      the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated convict knew the secret of\n      a penalty incurred by this man in former days; he denounced him, and had\n      him arrested, and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause the\n      banker Laffitte,\u2014I have the fact from the cashier himself,\u2014by\n      means of a false signature, to hand over to him the sum of over half a\n      million which belonged to M. Madeleine. This convict who robbed M.\n      Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact, you have nothing to\n      tell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert; he shot him\n      with a pistol. I, the person who is speaking to you, was present.\"\n    \n      \"Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the day\n      of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the point\n      where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides and the\n      Pont de Jena.\"\n    \n      Where are your free and compulsory schools? Does every one know how to\n      read in the land of Dante and of Michael Angelo? Have you made public\n      schools of your barracks? Have you not, like ourselves, an opulent\n      war-budget and a paltry budget of education? Have not you also that\n      passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience?\n      military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of\n      firing upon Garibaldi; that is to say, upon the living honor of Italy? Let\n      us subject your social order to examination, let us take it where it\n      stands and as it stands, let us view its flagrant offences, show me the\n      woman and the child. It is by the amount of protection with which these\n      two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to\n      be measured. Is prostitution less heartrending in Naples than in Paris?\n      What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what amount\n      of justice springs from your tribunals? Do you chance to be so fortunate\n      as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words: public\n      prosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold, the executioner, the\n      death penalty? Italians, with you as with us, Beccaria is dead and\n      Farinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize your state reasons. Have\n      you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and politics?\n      You have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes! Something\n      very similar has been done in France. Stay, let us pass miseries in\n      review, let each one contribute his pile, you are as rich as we. Have you\n      not, like ourselves, two condemnations, religious condemnation pronounced\n      by the priest, and social condemnation decreed by the judge? Oh, great\n      nation of Italy, thou resemblest the great nation of France! Alas! our\n      brothers, you are, like ourselves, Mis\u00e9rables.\n    \n      53 (return) [ Do you remember our sweet\n      life, when we were both so young, and when we had no other desire in our\n      hearts than to be well dressed and in love? When, by adding your age to my\n      age, we could not count forty years between us, and when, in our humble\n      and tiny household, everything was spring to us even in winter. Fair days!\n      Manuel was proud and wise, Paris sat at sacred banquets, Foy launched\n      thunderbolts, and your corsage had a pin on which I pricked myself.\n      Everything gazed upon you. A briefless lawyer, when I took you to the\n      Prado to dine, you were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to turn\n      round, and I heard them say: Is she not beautiful! How good she smells!\n      What billowing hair! Beneath her mantle she hides a wing. Her charming\n      bonnet is hardly unfolded. I wandered with thee, pressing thy supple arm.\n      The passers-by thought that love bewitched had wedded, in our happy\n      couple, the gentle month of April to the fair month of May. We lived\n      concealed, content, with closed doors, devouring love, that sweet\n      forbidden fruit. My mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart had\n      already responded. The Sorbonne was the bucolic spot where I adored thee\n      from eve till morn. 'Tis thus that an amorous soul applies the chart of\n      the Tender to the Latin country. O Place Maubert! O Place Dauphine! When\n      in the fresh spring-like hut thou didst draw thy stocking on thy delicate\n      leg, I saw a star in the depths of the garret. I have read a great deal of\n      Plato, but nothing of it remains by me; better than Malebranche and then\n      Lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial goodness with a flower\n      which thou gavest to me, I obeyed thee, thou didst submit to me; oh gilded\n      garret! to lace thee! to behold thee going and coming from dawn in thy\n      chemise, gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror! And who, then,\n      would forego the memory of those days of aurora and the firmament, of\n      flowers, of gauze and of moire, when love stammers a charming slang? Our\n      gardens consisted of a pot of tulips; thou didst mask the window with thy\n      petticoat; I took the earthenware bowl and I gave thee the Japanese cup.\n      And those great misfortunes which made us laugh! Thy cuff scorched, thy\n      boa lost! And that dear portrait of the divine Shakespeare which we sold\n      one evening that we might sup! I was a beggar and thou wert charitable. I\n      kissed thy fresh round arms in haste. A folio Dante served us as a table\n      on which to eat merrily a centime's worth of chestnuts. The first time\n      that, in my joyous den, I snatched a kiss from thy fiery lip, when thou\n      wentest forth, dishevelled and blushing, I turned deathly pale and I\n      believed in God. Dost thou recall our innumerable joys, and all those\n      fichus changed to rags? Oh! what sighs from our hearts full of gloom\n      fluttered forth to the heavenly depths!]\n    ", "Patrick Modiano was born on July 30, 1945, in Boulogne-Billancourt, a suburb of Paris. His father was a businessman and his mother an actress. After leaving school, he studied at Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV in Paris. He took private lessons in geometry from Raymond Queneau, a writer who was to play a decisive role for his development. Already in 1968, Modiano made his debut as a writer with La place de l'\u00e9toile, a novel that attracted much attention.Modiano's works centre on topics such as memory, oblivion, identity and guilt. The city of Paris is often present in the text and can almost be considered a creative participant in the works. Rather often his tales are built on an autobiographical foundation, or on events that took place during the German occupation. He sometimes draws material for his works from interviews, newspaper articles or his own notes accumulated over the years. His novels show an affinity with one another, and it happens that earlier episodes are extended or that persons recur in different tales. The author's hometown and its history often serve to link the tales together. A work of documentary character, with World War II as background, is Dora Bruder (1997; Dora Bruder, 1999) which builds on the true tale of a fifteen-year old girl in Paris who became one of the victims of the Holocaust.

This year marks the centenary of the birth of legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt and Paris has been paying homage to the inventor of Gypsy jazz.In the northern 18th arrondissement, near the banlieue of Saint-Ouen where Django's family moved their caravan from Belgium when he was a boy, a square was renamed Place Django Reinhardt in a ceremony to mark his birthday on 23 January. Other centenary celebrations include a performance of the Django 100 group of modern stars of jazz manouche at the Th\u00e9atre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es on 14 March and a centenary edition of the Django Reinhardt Festival in June at Samois-sur-Seine, south of Paris.\u00a0The clubs where Django made his name with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette of the Hot Club of France in the 1930s and 40s have for the most part either shut or turned into more modern jazz venues. Today, in a France where Gypsies remain outcasts, the best manouche musicians \u2013 young and old \u2013 can still be found on the city's outskirts. But Django's Minor Swing continues to echo across Paris's caf\u00e9-jazz scene every night. Here are a few cafes to watch jazz by.Paris's temple to Django Reinhardt, this bar in Saint-Ouen is near the spot where Django lived - and where he was badly burnt in a caravan-fire in 1928, losing the use of two fingers on his left hand which led to his distinctive jazz phrasing. Next to the March\u00e9 aux Puces, the flea and antique market that is a Sunday-afternoon must for visitors, the bar plays host every weekend to the guitarist Ninine Garcia, head of Paris's premier family of jazz manouchists. Fans share tables or stand at the bar sipping espressos and examining the cases of guitars played by former jazz greats on the walls. Behind the tiny bar is a restaurant/concert venue filled with fairground memorabilia that serves a standard French carte on weekends. Backstage is a lutherie (maker of string instruments) and jazz school teaching manouche chord-progressions to Django-wannabees.

The young orchestra was the successor to the \nillustrious Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire, created some 139 years \npreviously, in 1828.The Orchestre de Paris, which often appears in \nconjunction with the orchestra's own Chorus, combines the continuing energy of \nyouth with the maturity of experience. These musicians have regularly performed \nunder the direction of the world's most illustrious conductors, amongst them \nAbbado, Bernstein, B\u00f6hm, Boulez, Celibidache, Giulini, Haitink, Kubel\u00edk, Maazel, \nMehta and Ozawa. The orchestra has also accompanied the finest soloists of the \nday, building up over the years a repertoire that covers three centuries of \nmusic, from symphonic works to opera, embracing every tradition, and giving an \nimportant place to new music through its policy of commissions and first \nperformances in France. Reflecting this breadth of repertoire, the orchestra's \ndiscography is especially varied, and has won several international awards. Its \nmost recent recording to be released is the Symphonie fantastique of Hector \nBerlioz conducted by Christoph Eschenbach (Na\u00efve, 2002).In September 2002, \nthe Orchestre de Paris inaugurated its Paris residence at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador. \nThe orchestra has complete control of programming there throughout the season, \nwith the exception of the months of November and December. This new freedom \nenables it to develop around its own concert series a genuine artistic and \ncultural project.The Orchestre de Paris has shown its open-minded attitude \nto music in all its forms and reached new audiences by giving concerts in new \nvenues, programming chamber music series with the orchestra's soloists, and \npursuing an active policy to encourage young audiences.Since its foundation, \nthe Orchestre de Paris, which is financed by the French Government and the City \nof Paris, has given around one hundred concerts per year, a third of which take \nplace outside Paris or abroad, thanks to the assistance of the Cercle de \nl'Orchestre de Paris. It has appeared in many cities throughout France and has \nalso been applauded all over the world. The orchestra's triumphantly successful \ntenth tour of the USA under Christoph Eschenbach in January 2002 earned it a \nregular invitation to Carnegie Hall in New York for future seasons. The \nOrchestre de Paris has also been, from the beginning of its career, a regular \nguest at international festivals, amongst them Salzburg, Aix-en-Provence, \nSchleswig-Holstein, Berlin Festtage, the London Proms, Paris Mozart Festival, \nLinz Bruckner Festival, Settembre Musica (Turin), Musica (Strasbourg) and the \nEnesco Festival in Bucarest.The world's foremost conductors have served as \nmusic directors of the Orchestre de Paris.

And all shown via its huge 3D digital projector.\nBut in the age of home cinema and computers, director Alex Hellmann admits it\u2019s not easy filling those seats.\n\u201cWith a movie theatre of this size, it\u2019s difficult. We have to do a lot of shows. About 100 a year.\u201d\nShows like the Disney Christmas bonanza for kids and regular concerts with stars of the French music scene.\nIn 1998, the owner Philippe Hellmann extended the range of non-cinema activities and opened Les Etoiles du Rex, a kind of cinema museum based on reconstructions of the cinema\u2019s projection booth, recording studio and so on.\nIt\u2019s just welcomed its one millionth visitor.\nThe visit backstage kicks off in the elevator as you\u2019re transported up the Rex tower, giving you a panoramic view of the spectacular movie theatre from behind its huge screen. Archive film footage relates key moments in the history of the Grand Rex.\nBut the idea is also to bring cinema alive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only for fun, but also to educate,\u201d says Philippe Hellmann. And since learning becomes easier when you\u2019re actively involved, \u201cinteractivity is always the key,\u201d he adds.\nVisitors take part in a film set, dub over the voice of stars like Cary Grant or Shirley Maclaine, and join in a special effects session where you\u2019re required to look a bit scared as King Kong pounds on the glass divide separating you from the beast himself.\nYou end up being the star of your own little film. And needless to say you can buy it on DVD at the end of the visit as a souvenir.\nIt\u2019s an amusing and informative 50-minute tour and, unlike many visits which require you to wear headphones for foreign languages, Les Etoiles du Rex allows you to share the fun with your neighbour.\nAll the information and instructions are delivered by a suave, if cheesy, Hollywood-style male voice through overhead speakers. Good, clean fun for all the family!\nLes Etoiles du Rex, 1, boulevard Poissonni\u00e8re, 75002 Paris. Admission 9.80 euros. Visits are currently available in French, English, Italian and German.

While the cliche is somewhat of a cliche, it doesn't hurt to do your best to blend in to any local culture. If you want to pass as a Parisian in the City of Love, it\u2019s all about the attitude and a few insider tips and tricks.The French have a reputation all over the world for their nonchalant \"gallic\" shrug, and a touch of \"je ne sais quoi.\" It\u2019s a fine blend of disdain, lack of interest, and a desire not to sweat the small stuff. In Paris, mastering the look that says \"whatever\" is key to fitting in. Practice your DGAF look, which can niftily replace words and keep you from blowing your cover.\nBed-hair, messy chic \u2013 whatever you want to call it, the real secret to looking like a Parisienne is in the hairdo \u2013 or lack thereof. Forget the sleek \"done\" bun, in Paris it\u2019s all about a great cut and natural flow, as sported by the iconic Lou Doillon. For a style makeover, head to celebrity stylist John Nollet at the Park Hyatt Vendome. French screen icons Monica Belluci, Audrey Tautou, and Vanessa Paradis all swear by his talent and his apprentice performs miracles for about $225.\nEveryone knows fashion is forefront in Paris. Their perfect taste, and flawless style is something that comes as naturally as breathing. But, if you look closely there are some rules. Dress to impress by sticking to a simple color palate. Don\u2019t pack loud prints and wild patterns for a trip to the designer Capital of the World, keep it dark with greys, blues, and blacks. Think like Mr Ford. And, if you don\u2019t have racks of appropriate clothes at home, fear not. In Paris one can rent clothes for a fee. Showrooms like the Elss Collection, just off the Champs Elysees, offers all the latest pieces from Alberta Ferretti, Kenzo, Carven, Halston Heritage, Sophie Theallet, and Alexis Mabille. They will even give you style tips and tea. What more could a girl ask for?\nIt\u2019s an obvious one, but worth remembering: ban the guidebooks. Nothing says tourist quite like a map, and quite frankly, in the age of smartphones, it's inexcusable. Look like a local and stare at that little screen, just like everyone else. And, whatever you do, don\u2019t gawk or mosey. Stride with purpose. Everyone\u2019s in a hurry to get somewhere in Paris and if they're not, they must be tourists.There\u2019s no clich\u00e9 without fire, right? It\u2019s true, Parisians flirt. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable behavior, even when married. In fact, flirting is just the beginning, but that\u2019s another story. Just remember to always remain discreet.\nThis is not easy if it\u2019s your first visit to Paris and you want to see the sights. The good news is you can still see the landmarks, without actually succumbing to the lines with thousands of other visitors. To see Paris\u2019 most iconic sight, for example, venture into 7th, a charming neighborhood, where you can catch the market on Rue Cler or browse the boutiques, and, when you are least expecting it, turn a corner as the grand Eiffel Tower comes into view. You'll be surrounded by locals, chatting on a terrace or doing the weekly shopping \u2013 a far more authentic experience!You know what they say, the stomach is the way to the heart. Not everyone eats at five-star restaurants all the time. Get back to the basics with a local, in a real kitchen, with real people. Ms Benedicte Mesny runs the Parisian Kitchen where she offers private cooking classes in her home in the hip 17th arrondissement. You'll set the menu and then head to Marche Levis for the ingredients. In just a few hours you'll have picked up some skills to benefit you even when you go home!There\u2019s nothing worse than roaming the streets without knowing where to go. Do your homework and have a plan. Paris is in the midst of a cocktail craze (yes, we're a bit late to the party) so make a list of must-go-see bars like Le Ballroom or Le Fish Club on Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau. Actually, it\u2019s pretty safe to go to any of the Experimental Cocktail Club\u2019s venues if you're into mixology. For a romantic rendezvous in a posh surrounding, try Le Mathis, just behind Champs Elysees.\nTo prove you\u2019re a real local, pick your favorite arrondissement (neighborhood) and invest in a canvas tote that bears its number. Parisian based American, Kasia Dietz, is one of the city's chicest adopted residents and has designed a bag collection with the perfect choice of post codes to pick from. Pro tip: go with Rive Gauche/Rive Droite if you really can\u2019t make up your mind!\nA cigarette, that is. Sure it\u2019s bad for you, but it's still very much a part of Parisian life. It all depends how much you want to fit in. And, what happens in Paris, stays in Paris. Bien sur.\nI have written for everyone from the Guardian to the South China Morning Post & the Toronto Star, Harper's, Red, ELLE and the \u20181001 Escapes\u2019 book.

The buildings erected or adapted for libraries, dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries, are among the glories of French architecture, their stylish forms as impressive as the contents stored inside their walls.  Libraries seldom turn up on a tourist's itinerary. This makes them ideal havens for anyone eager to escape from one's fellow foreigners. It's worth risking a derisive glance from a Parisian bookworm, who no doubt regards you as an intruding barbarian anyway, to tiptoe through some of the city's most atmospheric public spaces.

Since 1982, dog mess has been hoovered up by a team of 140 riders on motor scooters fitted with vacuum cleaners. They were introduced by then Mayor Jacques Chirac. According to a council report, they gather only 20 per cent of the crottes, but cost half the dog excrement cleaning budget of 70 million francs (\u00a37m) a year.  Contassot plans to make dog-owners take greater responsibility for the mess and he has decided to scrap the motocrottes from 2004.  'This is an appalling decision,' said R\u00e9gine Noyer, chairwoman of a residents' association in the 16th arrondissement. 'Motocrottes are absolutely vital to Parisians' sense of well-being.'  Contassot is also to scrap the canisettes, fenced-off corners of each neighbourhood for the use of defecating dogs. He has ordered the installation of more than 100 plastic bag dispensers for excrement. And he is launching a public education project to encourage dog-owners to take responsibility for their pets' offensive visiting cards.  Each year about 1,000 people are charged with contravening Article 99-2 of the Paris Health Department rules, which says owners who fail to pick up the mess risk a fine of 1,200 francs (\u00a3120) or 3,000 francs (\u00a3300) for recidivists.  But dog-owners have not taken much notice of signs on lampposts with a picture of an owner armed with a pooper-scooper and bearing the slogan 'I love my neighbourhood, I pick it up'.  It seems Paris will continue to be one big dog toilet for some time to come.\n    The decision to scrap the motocrottes (crotte means turd) was announced last week by Yves Contassot, the Green Party assistant mayor in charge of the environment.

Foul Paris goes to the dogs", "Parisian dog-owners face on-the-spot fines if their canines are caught adding to the 15 tonnes of poo dumped on the capital's streets every day, writes Jon HenleyAfter decades of trying - and failing miserably - to clear up after its 200,000 dog owners, Paris has finally changed tack: as of yesterday, dog poo has been declared illegal and anyone allowing their canine to contribute to the 15 tonnes of it dumped on the capital's streets every day risks a fine of up to \u00a3300. \"It's the strict application of the principle that the polluter must pay,\" said Yves Contassot, the deputy mayor in charge of parks, refuse collection and environmental affairs. \"For far too long we've relied on a plainly nonexistent sense of civic duty among Paris dog-owners. Now we're finally going to get tough.\" Seventy Paris hygiene inspectors have already been authorised to dole out on-the-spot fines to offending proprietors, and as soon as parliament gets round to rubber-stamping a new law after the June general elections, some 1,400 city surveillance officers will be similarly empowered. Meanwhile, an enthusiastic brigade of 150 rollerblading, white-T-shirted youngsters have been specially hired to rush round town at dawn handing out helpful 36-page explanatory leaflets to surprised owners taking their pooch for an early-morning poo.Mr Contassot said that, from now on, the town hall was relying on such educational efforts and beginning to phase out all dedicated dog mess clean-up programmes -including the famous green \"motocrotte\" scooters introduced back when president  Jacques Chirac was mayor. Mr Contassot said the 70-odd motocrottes cost the city more than pounds3m a year and succeeded in collecting only about 20% of its dog mess. Ordinary street cleaners were more effective, he said, and much less expensive. In all, the official estimated, Paris spends \u00a36-10m a year clearing up its dog excrement. An in-depth 1998 study by the hygiene department calculated that the cost to the taxpayer worked out at some \u00a33.70 a kilo, or roughly 30p a turd. For the equivalent sum, the city renovated the entire Avenue d'Italie in 1999. And those cost estimations do not include collateral damage in the form of healthcare bills and loss-of-earnings claims from the average 650 Parisian men and women hospitalised every year after slipping up on a dog deposit. A variety of initiatives have been tried to solve the poo problem to date, all more or less ineffectual. One involved the recruitment of a 15-strong band of \"canine counsellors\" whose unenviable job it was to try to reason with often recalcitrant dog owners and point them politely in the direction of the gutter. Last year, the council also launched a shock poster campaign featuring big blown-up pictures of innocent young children, blind people and wheelchair users heading unknowingly towards a particularly offensive-looking pile of dog mess. The slogan read: \"Dog owners: you're absolutely right, why bother to clean it up? Let them do it for you.\" The initial response from dog-owners to yesterday's news was not notably encouraging. \"People will get up at 2am to avoid the cops if they have to,\" said  Richard Simonnet, a French bulldog owner in the Marais. \"Personally, I don't object to clearing up - as long as the dog's healthy. But what are you supposed to do if it has an upset stomach? They didn't think of that, did they?\" Mr Simonnet said only relentless 1984-style repression and massive fines would really work. Paris police have neither the manpower nor the willpower to devote such resources to a problem that, \"whatever way you put it, always sounds vaguely laughable\", he said. And, despite the town hall's tough new regime, Paris is still a long way behind some  European cities when it comes to fighting dog dirt. In spotlessly clean Geneva, for example, dog-owners caught in flagrante face a minimum fine of \u00a31,600 - and repeat offenders can be stung for a walloping \u00a38,000.\n    \"It's the strict application of the principle that the polluter must pay,\" said Yves Contassot, the deputy mayor in charge of parks, refuse collection and environmental affairs. \"For far too long we've relied on a plainly nonexistent sense of civic duty among Paris dog-owners.

Like many early and medieval hospitals it was a multipurpose institution which catered for the poor and sick, offering food and shelter, as well as medical care. From 1580, however, the hospital\u2019s regulations specified that doctors and surgeons were to visit patients twice a week. During this period the hospital often housed more than 3500 patients at the same time.During the French Revolution, pressure on the hospital was relieved through the creation of several new general hospitals and specialist hospitals, including those for children,\u00a0venereal disease and the mentally ill. The number of beds at the Hotel Dieu remained unchanged at 1400, but the hospital took in fewer patients, so that all now had their own bed. The death rate took longer to change, and remained higher than at other hospitals. This was because most of the city\u2019s serious accidents were admitted to the centrally located institution.\u00a0The hospital\u00a0was rebuilt on the opposite bank of the Seine, next to Notre Dame Cathedral, in the mid-1800s.

It does so with one goal in mind: to make the lessons learned from these agreements benefit Parisians directly. Friendship and cooperation agreements with other major world citiesCompetition between major world cities should not prevent them from sharing their experiences. They are all faced with similar challenges. The aim of friendship and cooperation agreements is to identify projects which could provide both partners with valuable knowledge and improve day-to-day living conditions for their citizens.

The partnership with the City of Prague on risk prevention bears witness to this drive. After major flooding hit the capital of the Czech Republic in the summer of 2002, it acquired extensive expertise on the issue. Prague has set up a system to alert the population in real time through mobile telephone networks.
